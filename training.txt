1. Happy are those whose | way is | blameless, *
who | walk · in the | law · of the | LORD!
2. Happy are they who ob- | serve his | decrees *
and | seek him · with | all their | hearts!
3. Who never do | any | wrong, *
but always | walk | in his | ways.
4. You laid down | your com- | mandments, *
that | we should | fully | keep them.
5. Oh, that my ways were made | so di- | rect *
That | I might | keep your | statutes.
6. Then I should not be | put to | shame, *
when I re- | gard all | your com- | mandments.
7. I will thank you with an | unfeigned | heart, *
when I have | learned your | righteous | judgments.
8. I will | keep your | statutes; *
do not | utter- | ly for- | sake me.
121. I have done what is | just and | right; *
do not deliver | me to | my op- | pressors.
122. Be surety for your | servant's | good; *
let | not the | proud op- | press me.
123. My eyes have failed from watching for | your sal- | vation *
and | for your | righteous | promise.
124. Deal with your servant according to your | loving- | kindness *
and | teach | me your | statutes.
125. I am your servant; grant me | under- | standing, *
that I may | know | your de- | crees.
126. It is time for you to | act, O | LORD, *
for | they have | broken · your | law.
127. Truly, I | love · your com- | mandments *
more than | gold and | precious | stones.
128. I hold all your commandments to be | right for | me; *
all paths of | falsehood | I ab- | hor.
9. How shall a young man | cleanse his | way? *
By | keeping | to your | words.
10. With my whole | heart I | seek you; *
let me not | stray from | your com- | mandments.
11. I treasure your promise | in my | heart, *
that I | may not | sin a- | gainst you.
12. Blessed are | you, O | LORD; *
in- | struct me | in your | statutes.
13. With my lips will | I re- | cite *
all the | judgments | of your | mouth.
14. I have taken greater joy in the way of | your de- | crees *
than | in all | manner · of | riches.
15. I will meditate on | your com- | mandments *
and give at- | tention | to your | ways.
16. My delight is | in your | statutes; *
I | will not · for- | get your | word.
25. My soul | cleaves · to the | dust; *
give me life ac- | cording | to your | word.
26. I have confessed my ways, and you | answered | me; *
in- | struct me | in your | statutes.
27. Make me understand the way of | your com- | mandments, *
that I may meditate | on your | marvel- · lous | works.
28. My soul melts a- | way for | sorrow; *
strengthen me ac- | cording | to your | word.
29. Take from me the | way of | lying; *
let me find | grace | through your | law.
30. I have chosen the | way of | faithfulness; *
I have | set your | judgments · be- | fore me.
31. I hold fast to | your de- | crees; *
O LORD, let me | not be | put to | shame.
32. I will run the way of | your com- | mandments, *
for you have | set my | heart at | liberty.
17. Deal bountifully | with your | servant, *
that I may | live and | keep your | word.
18. Open my eyes, that | I may | see *
the | wonders | of your | law.
19. I am a stranger | here on | earth; *
do not | hide · your com- | mandments | from me.
20. My soul is con- | sumed at · all | times *
with | longing | for your | judgments.
21. You have re- | buked the | insolent; *
cursed are they who | stray from | your com- | mandments!
22. Turn from me | shame · and re- | buke, *
for | I have | kept your | decrees.
23. Even though rulers sit and | plot a- | gainst me, *
I will | medi- · tate | on your | statutes.
24. For your decrees are | my de- | light, *
and | they are · my | counsel- | lors.
33. Teach me, O Lord, the | way of · your | statutes; *
and I shall | keep it | to the | end.
34. Give me understanding, and I shall | keep your | law; *
I shall | keep it · with | all my | heart.
35. Make me go in the path of | your com- | mandments, *
for | that is | my de- | sire.
36. Incline my heart to | your de- | crees *
and | not to | unjust | gain.
37. Turn my eyes from watching | what is | worthless; *
give me | life | in your | ways.
38. Fulfill your promise | to your | servant, *
which you | make to | those who | fear you.
39. Turn away the reproach | which I | dread, *
be- | cause your | judgments · are | good.
40. Behold, I long for | your com- | mandments; *
in your | righteous- · ness pre- | serve my | life.
57. You only are my | portion, · O | LORD; *
I have | promised · to | keep your | words.
58. I entreat you with | all my | heart, *
be merciful to me ac- | cording | to your | promise.
59. I have con- | sidered my | ways *
and turned my | feet t'ward | your de- | crees.
60. I hasten and | do not | tarry *
to | keep | your com- | mandments.
61. Though the cords of the | wicked · en- | tangle me, *
I do | not for- | get your | law.
62. At midnight I will rise to | give you | thanks, *
be- | cause of · your | righteous | judgments.
63. I am a companion of | all who | fear you *
and of | those who | keep · your com- | mandments.
64. The earth, O LORD, is | full of · your | love; *
in- | struct me | in your | statutes.
81. My soul has longed for | your sal- | vation; *
I have | put my | trust · in your | word.
82. My eyes have failed from | watching · for your | promise, *
and I say, "When | will you | comfort | me?"
83. I have become like a leather | flask · in the | smoke, *
but I have | not for- | gotten · your | statutes.
84. How much longer | must I | wait? *
when will you give judgment against | those who | perse- · cute | me?
85. The proud have dug | pits for | me; *
they | do not | keep your | law.
86. All your com- | mandments · are | true; *
help me, for they | perse- · cute | me with | lies.
87. They had almost made an end of | me on | earth, *
but | I have not | forsaken · your | commandments.
88. In your loving- | kindness, · re- | vive me, *
that I may | keep · the dec- | rees · of your | mouth.
89. O LORD, your word is | ever- | lasting; *
it stands | firm | in the | heavens.
90. Your faithfulness remains from one gener- | ation · to an- | other; *
you established the | earth, and | it a- | bides.
91. By your decree these | continue · to this | day, *
for | all things | are your | servants.
92. If my delight had not been | in your | law, *
I should have | perished · in | my af- | fliction.
93. I will never for- | get · your com- | mandments, *
because by | them you | give me | life.
94. I am yours; oh, that | you would | save me! *
for I | study | your com- | mandments.
95. Though the wicked lie in wait for me | to des- | troy me, *
I will apply my | mind to | your de- | crees.
96. I see that all things | come · to an | end, *
but your com- | mandment | has no | bounds.
97. Oh, how I | love your | law! *
all the day long | it is | in my | mind.
98. Your commandments have made me | wiser · than my | enemies, *
and | it is | always | with me.
99. I have more understanding than | all my | teachers, *
for your de- | crees | are my | study.
100. I am | wiser · than the | elders, *
because | I ob- | serve · your com- | mandments.
101. I restrain my feet from every | evil | way, *
that | I may | keep your | word.
102. I do not shrink | from your | judgments, *
because | you your- | self have | taught me.
103. How sweet are your words | to my | taste! *
they are sweeter than | honey | to my | mouth.
104. Through your commandments I gain | under- | standing; *
therefore I hate | ev'ry | lying | way.
105. Your word is a lantern | to my | feet *
and a | light up- | on my | path.
106. I have sworn and | am de- | termined *
to | keep your | righteous | judgments.
107. I am | deeply | troubled; *
preserve my life, O LORD, ac- | cording | to your | word.
108. Accept, O LORD, the willing tribute | of my | lips, *
and | teach | me your | judgments.
109. My life is always | in my | hand, *
yet I do | not for- | get your | law.
110. The wicked have set a | trap for | me, *
but I have not | strayed from | your com- | mandments.
111. Your decrees are my in- | heritance · for | ever; *
truly, they | are the | joy · of my | heart.
112. I have applied my heart to ful- | fill your | statutes *
for | ever · and | to the | end.
129. Your de- | crees are | wonderful; *
therefore I o- | bey · them with | all my | heart.
130. When your word goes forth | it gives | light; *
it gives under- | standing | to the | simple.
131. I open my | mouth and | pant; *
I | long for | your com- | mandments.
132. Turn to | me in | mercy, *
as you always do to | those who | love your | Name.
133. Steady my footsteps | in your | word; *
let no iniquity | have do- | minion | over me.
134. Rescue me from those | who op- | press me, *
and | I will | keep your · com- | mandments.
135. Let your countenance shine up- | on your | servant *
and | teach | me your | statutes.
136. My eyes shed | streams of | tears, *
because people | do not | keep your | law.
1 Be joyful in the LORD, | all you | lands; *
serve the LORD with gladness and come before his | presence | with a | song.
2 Know this: The LORD him- | self is | God; *
he himself has made us, and we are his; we are his people and the | sheep | of his | pasture.
3 Enter his gates with thanksgiving; go into his | courts with | praise; *
give thanks to him and | call up- | on his | Name.
4 For the LORD is good; his mercy is | ever- | lasting; *
and his faithfulness en- | dures from | age to | age.
1. I will sing of | mercy · and | justice; *
to you, O | LORD, will | I sing | praises.
2. I will strive to follow a | blameless | course; *
oh, when will you come to me? I will walk with sincerity of | heart with- | in my | house.
3. I will set no worthless thing be- | fore my | eyes; *
I hate the doers of evil deeds; they shall | not re- | main with | me.
4. A crooked heart shall be | far from | me; *
I | will | not know | evil.
5. Those who in secret slander their neighbors I | will de- | stroy; *
those who have a haughty look and a proud heart | I can- | not a- | bide.
6. My eyes are upon the faithful in the land, that they may | dwell with | me, *
and only those who lead a blameless | life shall | be my | servants.
7. Those who act deceitfully shall not | dwell in · my | house, *
and those who tell lies shall not con- | tinue | in my | sight.
8. I will destroy all the | wicked · in the | land, *
that I may root out all evildoers from the | city | of the | LORD.
1. LORD, hear my prayer, and let my cry | come be- | fore you; *
hide not your face from me | in the | day of | trouble.
2. Incline your | ear to | me; *
when I call, make | haste to | answer | me.
3. For my days drift a- | way like | smoke, *
and my bones are | hot as | burning | coals.
4. My heart is smitten like | grass and | withered, *
so that I for- | get to | eat my | bread.
5. Because of the | voice · of my | groaning *
I | am but | skin and | bones.
6. I have become like a vulture | in the | wilderness, *
like an | owl a- | mong the | ruins.
7. I lie a- | wake and | groan; *
I am like a sparrow, | lonely | on a | house-top.
8. My enemies revile me | all day | long, *
and those who scoff at me have | taken · an | oath a- | gainst me.
9. For I have eaten | ashes · for | bread *
and | mingled · my | drink with | weeping.
10. Because of your indig- | nation · and | wrath *
you have lifted me up and | thrown | me a- | way.
11. My days pass | like a | shadow, *
and I | wither | like the | grass.
12. But you, O LORD, en- | dure for | ever, *
and your | Name from | age to | age.
13. You will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to have | mercy · up- | on her; *
indeed, the ap- | pointed | time has | come.
14. For your servants love her | very | rubble, *
and are moved to pity | even | for her | dust.
15. The nations shall fear your | Name, O | LORD, *
and all the | kings · of the | earth your | glory.
16. For the LORD will | build up | Zion, *
and his | glory | will ap- | pear.
17. He will look with favor on the | prayer · of the | homeless; *
he will | not de- | spise their | plea.
18. Let this be written for a future | gener- | ation, *
so that a people yet un- | born may | praise the | LORD.
19. For the LORD looked down from his holy | place on | high; *
from the heavens | he be- | held the | earth.
20. That he might hear the | groan · of the | captive *
and set free | those con- | demned to | die.
21. That they may declare in Zion the | Name · of the | LORD, *
and his | praise | in Je- | rusalem.
22. When the peoples are | gathered · to- | gether, *
and the kindgoms | also, · to | serve the | LORD.
23. He has brought down my strength be- | fore my | time; *
he has shortened the | number | of my | days.
24. And I said, "O my God, do not take me away in the | midst · of my | days; *
your years endure through- | out all | gener- | ations.
25. In the beginning, O LORD, you laid the foundations | of the | earth, *
and the heavens are the | work | of your | hands.
26. They shall perish, but you will endure; they shall wear out | like a | garment; *
as clothing you will change them, | and they | shall be | changed;
27. But you are | always · the | same, *
and your | years will | never | end.
28. The children of your servants | shall con- | tinue, *
and their offspring shall | stand fast | in your | sight.
1. Bless the LORD, | O my | soul, *
and all that is within me | bless his | holy | Name.
2. Bless the LORD, | O my | soul, *
and for- | get not | all his | benefits.
3. He forgives | all your | sins *
and | heals all | your in- | firmities.
4. He redeems your life | from the | grave *
and crowns you with | mercy · and | loving- | kindness.
5. He satisfies you with | good | things, *
and your youth is re- | new'd | like an | eagle's.
6. The LORD | exe- · cutes | righteousness *
and judgment for | all who | are op- | pressed.
7. He made his ways | known to | Moses *
and his works | to the | children · of | Israel.
8. The LORD is full of com- | passion · and | mercy, *
slow to anger | and of | great | kindness.
9. He will not | always · ac- | cuse us, *
nor will he | keep his | anger · for | ever.
10. He has not dealt with us ac- | cording · to our | sins, *
nor rewarded us ac- | cording | to our | wickedness.
11. For as the heavens are high a- | bove the | earth, *
so is his mercy great up- | on | those who | fear him.
12. As far as the east | is · from the | west, *
so far has he re- | moved our | sins from | us.
13. As a father | cares · for his | children, *
so does the LORD | care for | those who | fear him.
14. For he himself knows where- | of · we are | made; *
he remembers | that we | are but | dust.
15. Our days are | like the | grass; *
we flourish like a | flower | of the | field;
16. When the wind goes over it, | it is | gone, *
and its | place shall | know it · no | more.
17. But the merciful goodness of the LORD endures for ever on | those who | fear him, *
and his | righteous- · ness on | children's | children;
18. On those who | keep his | covenant *
and remember his com- | mand- | ments and | do them.
19. The LORD has set his | throne in | heaven, *
and his kingship has do- | minion | over | all.
20. Bless the LORD, you angels of his, you mighty ones who | do his | bidding, *
and hearken | to the | voice · of his | word.
21. Bless the LORD, all | you his | hosts, *
you ministers of | his who | do his | will.
22. Bless the LORD, all you works of his, in all places of | his do- | minion; *
bless the | LORD, | O my | soul.
1. Bless the LORD, | O my | soul; *
O LORD, my God, how excellent is your greatness! you are | clothed with | majes- · ty and | splendor.
2. You wrap yourself with light as | with a | cloak *
and spread out the | heavens | like a | curtain.
3. You lay the beams of your chambers in the | waters · a- | bove; *
you make the clouds your chariot: you | ride the | wings · of the | wind.
4. You make the | winds your | messengers *
and | flames of | fire your | servants.
5. You have set the earth up- | on its · found- | ations, *
so that it never shall | move at | any | time.
6. You covered it with the Deep as | with a | mantle; *
the waters stood | higher | than the | mountains.
7. At your re- | buke they | fled; *
at the voice of your | thunder · they | hastened · a- | way.
8. They went up into the hills and down to the | valleys · be- | neath, *
to the places you | had ap- | pointed | for them.
9. You set the limits that they | should not | pass; *
they shall | not · again | cover · the | sea.
10. You send the springs | into · the | valleys; *
they | flow be- | tween the | mountains.
11. All the beasts of the field drink their | fill from | them, *
and the wild | asses | quench their | thirst.
12. Beside them the birds of the air | make their | nests *
and | sing a- | mong the | branches.
13. You water the mountains from your | dwelling · on | high; *
the earth is fully satisfied | by the | fruit · of your | works.
14. You make grass grow for | flocks and | herds *
and | plants to | serve man- | kind.
15. That they may bring forth | food · from the | earth, *
and wine to | gladden · our | hearts.
16. Oil to make a | cheerful | countenance, *
and | bread to | strengthen · the | heart.
17. The trees of the LORD are | full of | sap, *
the cedars of | Leban- · on | which he | planted.
18. In which the birds | build their | nests, *
and in whose | tops the | stork · makes his | dwelling.
19. The high hills are a refuge for the | mountain | goats, *
and the stony | cliffs for | the rock | badgers.
20. You appointed the moon to | mark the | seasons, *
and the sun knows the | time | of its | setting.
21. You make darkness that it | may be | night, *
in which the | beasts · of the | forest | prowl.
22. The lions roar | after · their | prey *
and | seek their | food from | God.
23. The sun rises, and they | slip a- | way *
and | lay · themselves | down · in their | dens.
24. Man goes | forth · to his | work *
and to his | labor | until | evening.
25. O LORD, how manifold | are your | works! *
in wisdom you have made them all; the | earth is | full of · your | creatures.
26. Yonder is the great and wide sea with its living creatures to | many · to | number, *
creatures | both | great and | small.
27. There move the ships, and there is | that Le- | viathan, *
which you have | made · for the | sport of | it.
28. All of them | look to | you *
to give them their | food in | due | season.
29. You give it to | them; they | gather it; *
you open your hand, and they are | filled | with good | things.
30. You hide your face, and | they are | terrified; *
you take away their breath, and they die and re- | turn to | their | dust.
31. You send forth your Spirit, and they | are cr- | eated; *
and so you re- | new the | face · of the | earth.
32. May the glory of the LORD en- | dure for | ever; *
may the LORD re- | joice in | all his | works.
33. He looks at the earth | and it | trembles; *
he touches the | mountains | and they | smoke.
34. I will sing to the LORD as | long as · I | live; *
I will praise my God | while I | have my | being.
35. May these words of | mine | please him; *
I | will re- | joice · in the | LORD.
36. Let sinners be consumed | out of · the | earth, *
and the | wicked | be no | more.
37. Praise the LORD, | O my | soul. *
Hal- | le- | lu- | jah!
1. Give thanks to the LORD and call up- | on his | Name; *
make known his | deeds a- | mong the | peoples.
2. Sing to him, sing | praises · to | him, *
and speak of | all his | marvel- · lous | works.
3. Glory in his | holy | Name; *
let the hearts of those who | seek the | LORD re- | joice.
4. Search for the LORD, | and his | strength; *
con- | tinu- · ally | seek his | face.
5. Remember the marvels | he has | done, *
his wonders and the | judgments | of his | mouth.
6. O offspring of | Abra- · ham his | servant, *
O children of | Ja- | cob his | chosen.
7. He is the | LORD our | God; *
his | judgments · pre- | vail · in the | world.
8. He has always been | mindful · of his | covenant, *
the promise he made for a | thousand | gener- | ations.
9. The covenant he | made with | Abraham, *
the oath | that he | swore to | Isaac,
10. Which he established as a | statute for | Jacob, *
an everlasting | cove- | nant for | Israel,
11. Saying, "To you I will give the | land of | Canaan *
to be | your al | lotted · in- | heritance."
12. When they were | few in | number, *
of little account, and | sojour- · ners | in the | land,
13. Wandering from | nation · to | nation *
and from | one · kingdom | to an- | other,
14. He let no one | oppress | them, *
and re- | buked kings | for their | sake.
15. Saying, "Do not | touch · my an- | ointed *
and | do my | prophets · no | harm."
16. Then he called for a famine | in the | land *
and de- | stroyed · the sup- | ply of | bread.
17. He sent a | man be- | fore them, *
Joseph, | who was | sold · as a | slave.
18. They bruised his | feet in | fetters; *
his neck they | put · in an | iron | collar.
19. Until his prediction | came to | pass, *
the | word · of the | LORD | tested him.
20. The king sent | and re- | leased him; *
the ruler of the | peoples | set him | free.
21. He set him as a master | over · his | household, *
as a ruler | over | all · his pos- | sessions.
22. To instruct his princes | according · to his | will *
and to | teach his | elders | wisdom
23. Israel | came · into | Egypt, *
and Jacob became a sojourner | in the | land of | Ham.
24. The LORD made his people ex- | ceeding- · ly | fruitful; *
he made them | stronger | than their | enemies.
25. Whose heart he turned, so that they | hated · his | people, *
and dealt un- | justly | with his | servants.
26. He sent | Moses · his | servant, *
and | Aaron | whom · he had | chosen.
27. They worked his | signs a- | mong them, *
and portents | in the | land of | Ham.
28. He sent darkness | and it · grew | dark; *
but the Egyptians re- | belled a- | gainst his | words.
29. He turned their waters | into | blood *
and | caused their | fish to | die.
30. Their land was | overrun · by | frogs, *
in the very | chambers | of their | kings.
31. He spoke, and there came | swarms of | insects *
and | gnats with- · in | all their | borders.
32. He gave them hailstones in- | stead of | rain, *
and flames of | fire through- | out their | land.
33. He blasted their | vines · and their | fig trees *
and shattered | ev'ry | tree · in their | country.
34. He spoke, and the | locusts | came, *
and young | locusts | without | number.
35. Which ate up all the green | plants · in their | land *
and de- | voured the | fruit · of their | soil.
36. He struck down the | firstborn · of their | land, *
the | firstfruits · of | all their | strength.
37. He led out his people with | silver · and | gold; *
in all their tribes there | was not | one that | stumbled.
38. So Egypt was | glad of · their | going, *
because | they · were a- | fraid of | them.
39. He spread out a | cloud · or a | covering *
and a fire to give | light in | the night | season.
40. They asked, and | quails ap- | peared, *
and he satisfied | them with | bread from | heaven.
41. He opened the rock, and | water | flowed, *
so the river | ran · in the | dry | places.
42. For God remembered his | holy | word *
and | Abra- | ham his | servant.
43. So he led forth his | people · with | gladness, *
his | chosen · with | shouts of | joy.
44. He gave his people the | lands · of the | nations, *
and they took the | fruit of | others' | toil.
45. That they might | keep his | statutes *
and observe his | laws. | Halle- | lujah.
1. Hallelujah! Give thanks to the LORD, for | he is | good, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever.
2. Who can declare the mighty | acts · of the | LORD *
or | show forth | all his | praise?
3. Happy are those who | act with | justice *
and always | do | what is | right.
4. Remember me, O LORD, with the favor you have | for your | people, *
and visit me | with your | saving | help.
5. That I may see the prosperity of your elect and be glad with the | gladness · of your | people, *
that I may glory | with your | inher- | itance.
6. We have sinned as our | forebears | did; *
we have done | wrong | and dealt | wickedly.
7. In Egypt they did not consider your marvelous works, nor remember the a- | bundance · of your | love; *
they defied the Most | High | at the · Red | Sea.
8. But he saved them for his | Name's | sake, *
to | make his | pow'r | known.
9. He rebuked the Red Sea, and it | dried | up, *
and he led them through the | deep as | through a | desert.
10. He saved them from the hand of | those who | hated them *
and redeemed them | from the | hand · of the | enemy.
11. The waters covered | their op- | pressors; *
not | one of | them was | left.
12. Then they be- | lieved his | words *
and | sang him | songs of | praise.
13. But they soon for- | got his | deeds *
and did not | wait | for his | counsel.
14. A craving seized them | in the | wilderness, *
and they put God to the | test | in the | desert.
15. He gave them | what they | asked, *
but sent | leanness | into · their | soul.
16. They envied Moses | in the | camp, *
and Aaron, the | holy | one · of the | LORD.
17. The earth opened and | swallowed | Dathan *
and covered the | compa- | ny of | Abiram.
18. Fire blazed up a- | gainst their | company, *
and | flames de- | voured the | wicked.
19. Israel made a | bull-calf · at | Horeb *
and | worshiped · a | molten | image.
20. And so they ex- | changed their | Glory *
for the image of an | ox that | feeds on | grass.
21. They forgot | God their | Savior, *
who had | done great | things in | Egypt.
22 Wonderful deeds in the | land of | Ham, *
and fearful things | at the | Red | Sea.
23. So he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him | in the | breach, *
to turn away his wrath | from con- | suming | them.
24. They refused the | pleasant | land *
and would | not be- | lieve his | promise.
25. They grumbled | in their | tents *
and would not listen to the | voice | of the | LORD.
26. So he lifted his | hand a- | gainst them, *
to over- | throw them | in the | wilderness,
27. To cast out their seed a- | mong the | nations, *
to scatter | them through- | out the | lands.
28. They joined themselves to | Ba'al- | Peor *
and ate sacrifices | offered | to the | dead.
29. They provoked him to anger | with their | actions, *
and a | plague broke | out a- | mong them.
30. Then Phinehas stood up and | inter- | ceded, *
and the | plague came | to an | end.
31. This was reckoned to | him as | righteousness *
throughout all | gener- | ations · for | ever.
32. Again they provoked his anger at the | waters · of | Meribah, *
so that he punished | Moses | because · of | them.
33. For they so em- | bittered · his | spirit *
that he | spoke rash | words · with his | lips.
34. They did not des- | troy the | peoples *
as the LORD | had com- | manded | them.
35. They intermingled | with the | heathen *
and | learned their | pagan | ways.
36. So that they | worshiped · their | idols, *
which be- | came a | snare to | them.
37. They sacri- | ficed their | sons *
and their | daughters · to | evil | spirits.
38. They shed innocent blood, the blood of their | sons and | daughters, *
which they offered to the idols of Canaan, and the land | was de- | filed with | blood.
39. Thus they were polluted | by their | actions *
and went whoring | in their | evil | deeds.
40. Therefore the wrath of the LORD was kindled a- | gainst his | people *
and he ab- | horred | his in- | heritance.
41. He gave them over the the | hand · of the | heathen, *
and those who | hated · them | ruled | over them.
42. Their ene- | mies op- | pressed them, *
and they were | humbled | under · their | hand.
43. Many a time did he deliver them, but they rebelled through their | own de- | vices, *
and were brought | down in | their in- | iquity.
44. Nevertheless, he saw | their dis- | tress, *
when he | heard their | lamen- | tation.
45. He remembered his | cove- · nant | with them *
and relented in accordance | with his | great | mercy.
46. He caused them | to be | pitied *
by | those who | held them | captive.
47. Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from a- | mong the | nations, *
that we may give thanks to your holy Name, and | glory | in your | praise.
48. Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, from everlasting to | ever- | lasting; *
and let all the people say, | "Amen!" | Halle- | lujah
1. Give thanks to the LORD, for | he is | good, *
and his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever.
2. Let those whom the LORD has re- | deemed pro- | claim *
that he redeemed them | from the | hand · of the | foe.
3. He gathered them | out of · the | lands; *
from the east and from the west, from the | north and | from the | south.
4. Some wandered in | desert | wastes; *
they found no way to a | city · where | they might | dwell.
5. They were | hungry · and | thirsty; *
their spirits | lan- | guished with- | in them.
6. Then they cried out to the LORD | in their | trouble, *
and he delivered | them from | their dis- | tress.
7. He put their feet on a | straight | path *
to go to a | city · where | they might | dwell.
8. Let them give thanks to the LORD | for his | mercy *
and the wonders he | does | for his | children.
9. For he | satis- · fied the | thirsty *
and fills the | hungry | with good | things.
10. Some sat in darkness and | deep | gloom, *
bound fast in | mise- | ry and | iron;
11. Because they rebelled against the | words of | God *
and despised the | counsel · of the | Most | High.
12. So humbled their spirits with | hard | labor; *
they stumbled, and | there was | none to | help.
13. Then they cried to the LORD | in their | trouble, *
and he de- | livered · them | from · their dis- | tress.
14. He led them out of darkness and | deep | gloom *
and | broke their | bonds a- | sunder.
15. Let them give thanks to the LORD | for his | mercy *
and the wonders he does | for his | children.
16. For he shatters the | doors of | bronze *
and breaks in | two the | iron | bars,
17. Some were fools and took to re- | bellious | ways; *
they were afflicted be- | cause | of their | sins.
18. They abhorred all | manner · of | food *
and drew | near to | death's | door.
19. Then they cried to the LORD | in their | trouble, *
and he de- | livered · them from | their dis- | tress.
20. He sent for his | word and | healed them *
and | saved them | from the | grave.
21. Let them give thanks to the LORD | for his | mercy *
and the wonders he does | for his | children.
22. Let them offer a | sacri- · fice of | thanksgiving *
and tell of his | acts with | shouts of | joy.
23. Some went down to the | sea in | ships *
and plied their | trade in | deep | waters.
24. They beheld the | works · of the | LORD *
and his | wonders | in the | deep.
25. Then he spoke, and a stormy | wind a- | rose, *
which tossed | high the | waves · of the | sea.
26. They mounted up to the heavens and fell | back · to the | depths; *
their hearts | melted · be- | cause · of their | peril.
27. They reeled and | staggered · like | drunkards *
and | were at | their wits' | end.
28. Then they cried out to the LORD | in their | trouble, *
and he de- | livered · them from | their dis- | tress.
29. He stilled the storm | to a | whisper *
and quieted the | waves | of the | sea.
30. Then were they glad be- | cause of · the | calm, *
and he brought them to the | harbor | they were | bound for.
31. Let them give thanks to the LORD | for his | mercy *
and the wonders he does | for his | children.
32. Let them exalt him in the congregation | of the | people *
and praise him in the | council | of the | elders.
33. The LORD changed rivers | into | deserts, *
and water-springs | into | thirsty | ground.
34. A fruitful land | into | salt flats, *
because of the | wicked- | ness of | those who | dwelt there.
35. He changed deserts into | pools of | water *
and | dry land | into | water-springs.
36. He settled the | hungry | there, *
and they | founded · a | city · to | dwell in.
37. They sowed fields, and | planted | vineyards, *
and | brought · in a | fruitful | harvest.
38. He bless'd them, so that they | increased | greatly; *
he did not | let their | herds de- | crease.
39. Yet when they were diminished | and brought | low, *
through stress of ad- | versi- | ty and | sorrow,
40. (He pours con- | tempt on | princes *
and makes them wander in trackless wastes)
41. He lifted up the poor | out of | misery *
and multiplied their | fami- · lies like | flocks of | sheep.
42. The upright will see this | and re- | joice, *
but all | wicked- · ness will | shut its | mouth.
43. Whosoever is wise will | ponder · these | things, *
and consider well the | mercies | of the | LORD.
1. My heart is firmly fixed, O God, my | heart is | fixed; *
I will | sing and | make | melody.
2. Wake up my spirit; awake, | lute and | harp; *
I myself will | wa- | ken the | dawn.
3. I will confess you among the | peoples, · O | LORD; *
I will sing praises to | you a- | mong the | nations.
4. For your loving-kindness is | greater · than the | heavens, *
and your faithfulness | reaches | to the | clouds.
5. Exalt yourself above the | heavens, · O | God, *
and your glory | over | all the | earth.
6. So that those who are dear to you may | be de- | livered, *
save with your | right | hand and | answer me.
7. God spoke from his holy | place and | said: *
"I will exult and parcel out Shechem; I will di- | vide the | valley · of | Succoth.
8. Gilead is mine and Man- asseh · is | mine; *
Ephraim is my helmet and | Ju- | dah my | scepter.
9. Moab is my wash-basin, on Edom I throw down my | sandal · to | claim it, *
and over Philistia | I will | shout in | triumph."
10. Who will lead me into the | strong | city? *
who will | bring me | into | Edom?
11. Have you not cast us | off, O | God? *
you no longer go out, O | God, | with our | armies.
12. Grant us your help a- | gainst the | enemy, *
for | vain · is the | help of | man.
13. With God we will do | valiant | deeds, *
and he shall tread our | ene- · mies | under | foot.
1. Hold not your tongue, O | God of — | my praise; *
for the mouth of the wicked, the mouth of the de- | ceitful, · is | opened a- | gainst me.
2. They speak to me with a | lying | tongue; *
they encompass me with hateful words and fight a- | gainst me | without · a | cause.
3. Despite my love, they | accuse | me; *
but as for | me, | pray for | them.
4. They repay | evil · for | good, *
and | hatred | for my | love.
5. Set a wicked | man a- | gainst him, *
and let an accuser | stand at | his right | hand.
6. When he is judged, let | him be · found | guilty, *
and let his ap- | peal | be in | vain.
7. Let his | days be | few, *
and let an- | other | take his | office.
8. Let his | children · be | fatherless, *
and his | wife be- | come a | widow.
9. Let his children be | waifs and | beggars; *
let them be driven from the | ruins | of their | homes.
10. Let the creditor seize | every- · thing he | has; *
let | strangers | plunder · his | goods.
11. Let there be no one to | show him | kindness, *
and none to | pity · his | father- · less | children.
12. Let his descendents | be des- | troyed, *
and his name be blotted out | in the | next · gener- | ation.
13. Let the wickedness of his fathers be remembered be- | fore the | LORD, *
and his mother's sin | not be | blotted | out.
14. Let their sin be always be- | fore the | LORD; *
but let him | root out · their | names · from the | earth.
15. Because he did not re- | member · to show | mercy, *
but persecuted the poor and needy and sought to | kill the | broken- | hearted.
16. He loved cursing, let it | come up- | on him; *
he took no delight in blessing, | let it · de- | part from | him.
17. He put on cursing | like a | garment, *
let it soak into his body like water and | into · his | bones like | oil.
18. Let it be to him like the cloak which he | wraps a- · round him- | self, *
and like the belt | that he | wears con- | tinually.
19. Let this be the recompense from the LORD to | my ac- | cusers, *
and to those who speak | ev- | il a- | gainst me.
20. But you, O LORD my God, oh, deal with me ac- | cording to · your | Name; *
for your tender | mercy's | sake, de- | liver me.
21. For I am | poor and | needy, *
and my heart is | wound- | ed with- | in me.
22. I have faded away like a | shadow · when it | lengthens; *
I am | shaken · off | like a | locust.
23. My knees are weak e- | nough through | fasting, *
and my | flesh is | wasted · and | gaunt.
24. I have become a re- | proach to | them; *
they | see and | shake their | heads.
25. Help me, O | LORD my | God; *
save me | for your | mercy's | sake.
26. Let them know that | this is · your | hand, *
that | you, O | LORD, have | done it.
27. They may curse, but | you will | bless; *
let those who rise up against me be put to shame, and your | servant | will re- | joice.
28. Let my accusers be | cloth'd | with dis- | grace *
and wrap themselves in their | shame as | in a | cloak.
29. I will give great thanks to the LORD | with my | mouth; *
in the midst of the | multi- · tude | will I | praise him;
30. Because he stands at the right | hand · of the | needy, *
to save his life from | those who | would con- | demn him.
1. Why do you stand so far | off, O | LORD, *
and hide yourself | in the | time of | trouble?
2. The wicked arrogantly | perse- · cute the | poor, *
but they are trapped in the | schemes they | have de- | vised.
3. The wicked boast of their | heart's de- | sire; *
the covetous | curse · and re- | vile the | LORD.
4. The wicked are so proud that they care | not for | God; *
their only thought is, | "God | does not | matter."
5. Their ways are devious at all times; your judgments are far above | out of · their | sight; *
they de- | fy | all their | enemies.
6. They say in their heart, "I shall | not be | shaken; *
no harm shall | happen | to me | ever."
7. Their mouth is full of cursing, de- | ceit and · op- | pression; *
under their | tongue are | mischief · and | wrong.
8. They lurk in ambush in public squares and in secret places they | murder · the | innocent; *
they | spy | out the | helpless.
9. They lie in wait, like a lion in a covert; they lie in wait to seize up- | on the | lowly; *
they seize the lowly and drag them a- | way | in their | net.
10. The innocent are broken and | humbled · be- | fore them; *
the helpless | fall be- | fore their | power.
11. They say in their heart, | "God · has for- | gotten; *
he hides his face; | he will | never | notice."
12. Rise up, O LORD; lift up your | hand, O | God; *
do | not for- | get · the af- | flicted.
13. Why should the wicked re- | vile | God? *
why should they say in their | heart, | "You · do not | care"?
14. Surely, you behold | trouble · and | misery; *
you see it and | take it | into · your | hand.
15. The helpless commit them- | selves to | you, *
for you are the | hel- | per of | orphans.
16. Break the power of the | wicked · and | evil; *
search out their wickedness | until | you find | none.
17. The LORD is King for | ever · and | ever; *
the ungodly shall | perish | from his | land.
18. The LORD will hear the de- | sire · of the | humble; *
you will strengthen their heart | and your | ears shall | hear;
19. To give justice to the | orphan · and op- | pressed, *
so that mere mortals | may strike | terror · no | more.
1. The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at | my right | hand, *
until I make your | ene- | mies your | footstool."
2. The LORD will send the scepter of your power | out of | Zion, *
saying, "Rule over your | ene- · mies | round a- | bout you.
3. Princely state has been yours from the | day of · your | birth; *
in the beauty of holiness have I begotten you, like dew from the | womb | of the | morning."
4. The LORD has sworn and will | not re- | cant: *
"You are a priest for ever | after · the | order · of Mel- | chizedek."
5. The Lord who is at your right hand will smite kings in the | day · of his | wrath; *
he will | rule | over · the | nations.
6. He will heap | high the | corpses; *
he will smash heads | over | the wide | earth.
7. He will drink from the brook be- | side the | road; *
therefore he | will lift | high his | head.
1. Hallelujah! I will give thanks to the LORD with my | whole | heart, *
in the assembly of the upright, | in the | congre- | gation.
2. Great are the | deeds · of the | LORD! *
they are studied by | all · who de- | light in | them.
3. His work is full of | majes- · ty and | splendor, *
and his | righteous- · ness en- | dures for | ever.
4. He makes his marvelous works to | be re- | membered; *
the LORD is | gracious · and | full · of com- | passion.
5. He gives food to | those who | fear him; *
he is ever | mindful | of his | covenant.
6. He has shown his people the | pow'r · of his | works *
in giving | them the | lands of | nations.
7. The works of his hands are | faithful- · ness and | justice; *
all | his · command- | ments are | true.
8. They stand fast for | ever · and | ever, *
because they are | done in | truth and | equity.
9. He sent redemption to his people; he commanded his | cove- · nant for | ever; *
holy and | awesome | is his | Name.
10. The fear of the LORD is the be- | ginning · of | wisdom; *
those who act accordingly have a good understanding; his | praise en- | dures for | ever.
1. Hallelujah! Happy are they who | fear the | LORD *
and have great de- | light in | his com- | mandment.
2. Their descendants will be mighty | in the | land; *
the generation of the | upright | will be | blessed.
3. Wealth and riches will be | in their | house, *
and righteous- | ness will | last for | ever.
4. Light shines in the darkness | for the | upright; *
the righteous are | merciful · and | full · of com- | passion.
5. It is good for them to be | generous · in | lending *
and to manage their af- | fairs with | justice.
6. For they will | never · be | shaken; *
the righteous will be kept in | ever- | lasting · re- | membrance.
7. They will not be afraid of any | evil | rumors; *
their heart is right; they | put their | trust · in the | Lord.
8. Their heart is established and | will not | shrink, *
until they | see · their de- | sire · on their | enemies.
9. They have given freely | to the | poor, *
and their righteousness stands fast for ever; they will | hold up · their | head with | honor.
10. The wicked will see it and be angry; they will gnash their teeth and | pine a- | way; *
the | desires · of the | wicked · will | perish.
1. Hallelujah! Give praise, you | servants · of the | LORD; *
praise the | Name | of the | LORD.
2. Let the Name of the | LORD be | blessed, *
from this time | forth for | ever- | more.
3. From the rising of the sun to its | going | down *
let the | Name · of the | LORD be | praised.
4. The LORD is high a- | bove all | nations, *
and his | glory · a- | bove the | heavens.
5. Who is like the LORD our God, who sits en- | throned on | high, *
but stoops to be- | hold the | heav'ns · and the | earth?
6. He takes up the weak | out · of the | dust *
and lifts up the | poor | from the | ashes.
7. He | sets them · with | princes, *
with the | princes | of his | people.
8. He makes the woman of a | childless | house *
to be a | joyful | mother · of | children.
1 Hallelujah! When Israel came | out of | Egypt, *
the house of Jacob from a | people · of | strange | speech,
2 Judah became | God's sanc- | tuary *
and Israel | his do- | minion.
3 The sea be- | held it · and | fled; *
Jordan | turned and | went | back.
4 The mountains | skipped like | rams, *
and the little | hills like | young | sheep.
5 What ailed you, O sea, | that you | fled? *
O Jor- | dan, · that you | turned | back?
6 You mountains, that you | skipped like | rams? *
you little | hills like | young | sheep?
7 Tremble, O earth, at the | presence · of the | Lord, *
at the presence | of the | God of | Jacob,
8 Who turned the hard rock into a | pool of | water *
and flint-stone | into · a | flowing | spring.
1. Not to us, O LORD, not to us, but to your | Name give | glory; *
because of your love and be- | cause | of your | faithfulness.
2. Why should the | heathen | say, *
"Where | then is | their | God?"
3. Our God | is in | heaven; *
whatever he | wills to | do he | does.
4. Their idols are | silver · and | gold, *
the | work of | human | hands.
5. They have mouths, but they | cannot | speak; *
eyes have they, | but they | cannot | see;
6. They have ears, but they | cannot | hear; *
noses, | but they | cannot | smell;
7. They have hands, but they cannot feel; feet, but they | cannot | walk; *
they make | no sound | with their | throat.
8. Those who | make them · are | like them, *
and so are all who | put their | trust in | them.
9. O Israel, | trust · in the | LORD; *
he is their | help | and their | shield.
10. O house of Aaron, | trust · in the | LORD, *
he is their | help | and their | shield
11. You who fear the LORD, | trust · in the | LORD; *
he is their | help | and their | shield
12. The LORD has been mindful of us, and | he will | bless us; *
he will bless the house of Israel; he will | bless the | house of | Aaron;
13. He will bless those who | fear the | LORD, *
both | small and | great to- | gether.
14. May the LORD increase you | more and | more, *
you and your | children | after | you.
15. May you be | bless'd · by the | LORD, *
the | maker · of | heav'n and | earth.
16. The heaven of heavens | is the | LORD's, *
but he entrusted the | earth | to its | peoples.
17. The dead do not | praise the | LORD, *
nor all those who | go down | into | silence;
18. But we will | bless the | LORD, *
from this time forth for ever- | more. | Halle- | lujah!
1. I love the LORD, because he has heard the voice of my | suppli- | cation, *
because he has inclined his ear to me when- | ever · I | called up- | on him.
2. The cords of death entangled me; the grip of the grave took | hold of | me; *
I | came to | grief and | sorrow.
3. Then I called upon the | Name · of the | LORD: *
"O LORD, I | pray you, | save my | life."
4. Gracious is the | LORD and | righteous; *
our | God is | full · of com- | passion.
5. The LORD watches | over · the | innocent; *
I was brought very | low, | and he | helped me.
6. Turn again to your rest, | O my | soul, *
for the | LORD has | treated · you | well.
7. For you have rescued my | life from | death, *
my eyes from tears, | and my | feet from | stumbling.
8. I will walk in the | presence · of the | LORD *
in the | land | of the | living.
9. I believed, even when I said, "I have been | brought · very | low." *
In my distress I said, | "No one | can be | trusted."
10. How shall I re- | pay the | LORD *
for all the | good things | he has | done for me?
11. I will lift up the | cup of · sal- | vation *
and call up- | on the | Name · of the | LORD.
12. I will fulfill my vows | to the | LORD *
in the | presence · of | all his | people.
13. Precious in the | sight · of the | LORD *
is the | death | of his | servants.
14. O LORD, | I am · your | servant; *
I am your servant and the child of your handmaid; you have | freed me | from my | bonds.
15. I will offer you the sacri- | fice of | thanksgiving *
and call up- | on the | Name · of the | LORD.
16. I will fulfill my | vows · to the | LORD *
in the | presence · of | all his | people.
17. In the courts of the | LORD's | house, *
in the midst of you, O Je- | rusa- · lem. | Halle- | lujah!
1. Praise the LORD, | all you | nations; *
laud | him, | all you | peoples.
2. For his loving-kindness t'ward | us is | great, *
and the faithfulness of the LORD endures for ev- | er. Hal- | lelu- | jah!
1. Give thanks to the LORD, for | he is | good; *
his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever.
2. Let Israel | now pro- | claim, *
"His | mercy · en- | dures for | ever."
3. Let the house of | Aaron · pro- | claim, *
"His | mercy · en- | dures for | ever."
4. Let those who fear the LORD | now pro- | claim, *
"His | mercy · en- | dures for | ever."
5. I called to the LORD in | my dis- | tress; *
the LORD | answered by | setting · me | free.
6. The LORD is on my side, I | will not | fear; *
what can | anyone | do to | me?
7. The LORD is on my side to help me; *
I will triumph over those who hate me.
8. It is better to re- | ly · on the | LORD *
than to put | any | trust in | flesh.
9. It is better to re- | ly · on the | LORD *
than to put | any | trust in | rulers.
10. All the ungodly en- | compass | me; *
in the Name of the | LORD | | I will · re- | pel them.
11. They hem me in, they hem me in on | ev'ry | side; *
in the Name of the | LORD | I will · re- | pel them.
12. They swarm about me like bees; they blaze like a | fire of | thorns; *
in the Name of the | LORD | I will · re- | pel them.
13. I was pressed so hard that I | almost | fell, *
but the | LORD | came to · my | help.
14. The LORD is my | strength · and my | song, *
and he | has be- | come · my sal- | vation.
15. There is a sound of exult- | ation · and | victory *
in the | tents | of the | righteous.
16. "The right hand of the | LORD has | triumphed! *
the right hand of the LORD is exalted! the right hand | of the | LORD has | triumphed!"
17. I shall not | die, but | live, *
and de- | clare the | works · of the | LORD.
18. The LORD has | punished · me | sorely, *
but he did not | hand me | over · to | death.
19. Open for me the | gates of | righteousness; *
I will enter them; I will offer | thanks | to the | LORD.
20. "This is the | gate · of the | LORD; *
he | who is | righteous · may | enter."
21. I will give thanks for you, | for you | answered me *
and | have be- | come · my sal- | vation.
22. The same stone which the | builders · re- | jected *
has be- | come the | chief | cornerstone.
23. This is the | LORD's | doing, *
and it is | marvel- · ous | in our | eyes.
24. On this day the | LORD has | acted; *
we will re- | joice | and be | glad in it.
25. Hosanna, | LORD, ho- | sanna! *
LORD, | send us | now suc- | cess.
26. Blessed is he who comes in the | Name · of the | Lord; *
we bless you | from the | house · of the | LORD.
27. God is the LORD; he has | shined up- | on us; *
form a procession with branches up to the | horns | of the | altar.
28. "You are my God, and | I will | thank you; *
you are my God, | and I | will ex- | alt you."
29. Give thanks to the LORD, for | he is | good; *
his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever.
1. In the LORD | have I · taken | refuge; *
how then can you say to me, "Fly away | like a | bird · to the | hilltop;
2. For see how the wicked bend the bow and fit their arrows | to the | string, *
to shoot from ambush | at the | true of | heart.
3. When the foundations are | being · des- | troyed, *
what | can the | righteous | do?"
4. The LORD is in his | holy | temple; *
the LORD's | throne | is in | heaven.
5. His eyes behold the in- | habit- · ed | world; *
his piercing | eye | weighs our | worth.
6. The LORD weighs the righteous as | well · as the | wicked, *
but those who delight in | vio- · lence | he ab- | hors.
7. Upon the wicked he shall rain coals of fire and | burning | sulphur; *
a scorching | wind shall | be their | lot.
8. For the LORD is righteous; he delights in | righteous | deeds; *
and the | just shall | see his | face.
1. When I was in trouble, I | called · to the | LORD; *
I called to the LORD, | and he | answered | me.
2. Deliver me, O LORD, from | lying | lips *
and from | the de- | ceitful | tongue.
3. What shall be done to you, and what | more be- | sides, *
O | you de- | ceitful | tongue?
4. The sharpened arrows | of a | warrior, *
a- | long with | hot · glowing | coals.
5. How hateful it is that I must | lodge in | Meshesh *
and dwell a- | mong the | tents of | Kedar!
6. Too long have I | had to | live *
a- | mong the | ene- · mies of | peace.
7. I am on the | side of | peace, *
but when I | speak · of it, they are · for | war.
1. I lift up my | eyes · to the | hills; *
from | whence · is my | help to | come?
2. My help comes | from the | LORD, *
the | maker · of | heav'n and | earth.
3. He will not let your | foot be | moved *
and he who watches over you | will not | fall a- | sleep.
4. Behold, he who keeps | watch · over | Israel *
shall | neither | slumber · nor | sleep;
5. The LORD himself | watches · over | you; *
the LORD is your | shade at | your right | hand.
6. So that the sun shall not | strike you · by | day, *
nor | — the | moon by | night.
7. The LORD shall preserve you | from all | evil; *
it is | he · who shall | keep you | safe.
8. The LORD shall watch over your going out and your | coming | in, *
from this time | forth for | ever- | more.
1. I was glad when they | said to | me, *
"Let us | go to · the | house of · the | LORD."
2. Now our | feet are | standing *
within your | gates, | O Je- | rusalem.
3. Jerusalem is | built · as a | city *
that is at | uni- · ty | with it- | self;
4. To which the tribes go up, the | tribes · of the | LORD, *
the assembly of Israel, to | praise the | Name · of the | LORD.
5. For there are the | thrones of | judgment, *
the | thrones · of the | house of | David.
6. Praise for the | peace of · Je- | rusalem: *
"May they | prosper · who | love | you.
7. Peace be with- | in your | walls *
and | quiet- · ness with- | in your | towers.
8. For my brethren and com- | panions' | sake, *
I | pray for | your pros- | perity.
9. Because of the house of the | LORD our | God, *
I will | seek to | do you | good."
1. To you I | lift up · my | eyes, *
to you en- | throned | in the | heavens.
2. As the eyes of servants look to the | hand of · their | masters, *
and the eyes of a | maid · to the | hand of · her | mistress,
3. So our eyes look to the | LORD our | God, *
un- | til he | show us · his | mercy.
4. Have mercy upon us, O | LORD, have | mercy, *
for we have had | more · than e- | nough · of con- | tempt.
5. Too much of the | scorn · of the | indo- · lent | rich, *
and of the de- | rision | of the | proud.
1. If the LORD had not been | on our | side, *
let | Israel | now | say;
2. If the LORD had not been | on our | side, *
when | ene- · mies | rose up · a- | gainst us;
3. Then would they have swallowed us | up a- | live *
in their | fierce | anger · to- | ward us.
4. Then would the torrents have | over- | whelmed us *
and the | torrent | gone | over us;
5. Then would the | raging | waters *
have | gone right | over | us.
6. Blessed | be the | Lord! *
he has not given us over to | be a | prey · for their | teeth.
7. We have escaped like a bird from the | snare · of the | fowler; *
the snare is broken, | and we | have es- | caped.
8. Our help is in the | Name · of the | LORD, *
the | maker · of | heav'n and | earth.
1. Those who trust in the LORD are | like Mount | Zion, *
which cannot be moved, but | stands | fast for | ever.
2. The hills stand a- | bout Je- | rusalem; *
so does the LORD stand round about his people, from this time | forth for | ever- | more.
3. The scepter of the wicked shall not hold sway over the land allotted | to the | just, *
so that the just shall not | put their | hands to | evil.
4. Show your goodness, O LORD, to | those · who are | good *
and to | those · who are | true of | heart.
5. As for those who turn aside to crooked ways, the LORD will lead them away with the | evil- | doers; *
but | peace be | upon | Israel.
1 When the LORD restored the | fortunes · of | Zion, *
then were we like | those who | dream.
2 Then was our mouth | filled with | laughter, *
and our | tongue with | shouts of | joy.
3 Then they said a- | mong the | nations, *
"The LORD has | done great | things for | them."
4 The LORD has done great | things for | us, *
and | we are | glad in- | deed.
5 Restore our | fortunes, · O | LORD, *
like the | water- · courses | of the | Negev.
6 Those who | sowed with | tears *
will | reap with | songs of | joy.
7 Those who go out weeping, | carry- · ing the | seed, *
will come again with joy, | shoulder- | ing their | sheaves.
1. Unless the LORD | builds the | house, *
their labor | is in | vain who | build it.
2. Unless the LORD watches | over · the | city, *
in vain the | watchman | keeps his | vigil.
3. It is in vain that you rise so early and go to | bed so | late; *
vain, too, to eat the bread of toil, for he gives to | his be- | loved | sleep.
4. Children are a heritage | from the | LORD, *
and the | fruit · of the | womb · is a | gift.
5. Like arrows in the | hand · of a | warrior *
are the | children | of one's | youth.
6. Happy is the man who has his | quiver | full of them! *
he shall not be put to shame when he contends with his e- | nemies | in the | gate.
1. Happy are they all who | fear the | LORD, *
and who | follow | in his | ways!
2. You shall eat the | fruit · of your | labor; *
happiness and pros- | peri- · ty | shall be | yours.
3. Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine with- | in your | house, *
your children like olive shoots | round a- | bout your | table.
4. The man who | fears the | LORD *
shall | thus in- | deed be | bless'd.
5. The LORD bless | you from | Zion, *
and may you see the prosperity of Jerusalem all the | days | of your | life.
6. May you live to see your | children's | children; *
may | peace | be · upon | Israel.
1. "Greatly have they oppressed me | since my | youth," *
let | Israel | now | say:
2. "Greatly have they oppressed me | since my | youth, *
but they have | not pre- | vailed a- | gainst me."
3. The plowmen plowed up- | on my | back *
and | made their | furrows | long.
4. The LORD, the | Righteous | One, *
has | cut the | cords · of the | wicked.
5. Let them be put to shame and | thrown | back, *
all those who are | ene- | mies of | Zion.
6. Let them be like grass up- | on the | housetops, *
which withers be- | fore it | can be | plucked.
7. Which does not fill the | hand · of the | reaper, *
nor the bosom of | him who | binds the | sheaves.
8. So that those who go by say not as much as, "The | LORD | prosper you. *
We wish you | well · in the | Name · of the | LORD."
1 Help me, LORD, for there is no | godly · one | left; *
the faithful have | vanished | from a- | mong us.
2 Everyone speaks falsely | with his | neighbor; *
with a smooth tongue they | speak · from a | double | heart.
3 Oh, that the LORD would cut off | all smooth | tongues, *
and close the | lips that | utter · proud | boasts!
4 Those who say, "With our tongue will | we pre- | vail; *
our lips are our own; | who is | lord · over | us?"
5 "Because the needy are oppressed, and the poor cry | out in | misery, *
I will rise up," says the LORD, "and | give them · the | help they | long for."
6 The words of the LORD are | pure | words, *
like silver refined from ore and purified | seven | times · in the | fire.
7 O LORD, | watch · over | us *
and save us from this | gener- | ation · for | ever.
8 The wicked prowl on | every | side, *
and that which is worthless is | highly | prized by | everyone.
1 Out of the depths have I called to you, O LORD; Lord, | hear my | voice; *
let your ears consider well the | voice · of my | suppli- | cation.
2 If you, LORD, were to note what is | done a- | miss, *
O | LORD, | who could | stand?
3 For there is for- | giveness · with | you; *
there- | fore you | shall be | feared.
4. I wait for the LORD; my soul | waits for | him; *
in his | word | is my | hope.
5 My soul waits for the LORD, more than watchmen | for the | morning, *
more than | watchmen | for the | morning.
6 O Israel, | wait · for the | LORD, *
for with the | LORD | there is | mercy;
7 With him there is | plenteous · re- | demption, *
and he shall redeem | Israel · from | all their | sins.
1. O LORD, I | am not | proud; *
I | have no | haughty | looks.
2. I do not occupy myself with | great | matters, *
or with things that | are too | hard for | me.
3. But I still my soul and make it quiet, like a child upon its | mother's | breast; *
my | soul is | quie- · ted | within me.
4. O Israel, wait up- | on the | LORD, *
from this time | forth for | ever- | more.
1. LORD, re- | member | David, *
and all the | hardships | he en- | dured;
2. How he swore an | oath · to the | LORD *
and vowed a vow to the | Mighty | One of | Jacob:
3. "I will not come under the | roof of · my | house, *
nor climb | up in- | to my | bed.
4. I will not allow my | eyes to | sleep, *
nor | let my | eyelids | slumber;
5. Until I find a | place · for the | LORD, *
a dwelling for the | Mighty | One of Jacob."
6. "The ark! We heard it | was in | Ephratah; *
we found it | in the | fields of | Jearim.
7. Let us go to | God's | dwelling place; *
let us fall upon our | knees be- | fore his | footstool."
8. Arise, O LORD, | into · your | resting-place, *
you | and the | ark · of your | strength.
9. Let your priests be | clothed with | righteousness; *
let your faithful | people | sing with | joy.
10. For your servant | David's | sake, *
do not turn a- | way the | face of · your A- | nointed.
11. The LORD has sworn an | oath to | David; *
in | truth, he | will not | break it.
12. "A son, the | fruit · of your | body *
will I | set up- | on your | throne.
13. If your children keep my covenant and my testimonies that | I shall | teach them, *
their children will sit upon your | throne for | ever- | more."
14. For the LORD has | chosen | Zion; *
he has desired her | for his | habit- | ation:
15. "This shall be my | resting- · place for | ever; *
here will I dwell, for | I de- | light in | her.
16. I will surely | bless · her pro- | visions, *
and satis- | fy her | poor with | bread.
17. I will clothe her | priests with · sal- | vation, *
and her faithful people | will rej- · oice and | sing.
18. There will I make the horn for | David | flourish; *
I have prepared a | lamp for | my A- | nointed.
19. As for his enemies, I will | clothe them · with | shame; *
but as for | him, his | crown will | shine.
1. Oh, how good and | pleasant · it | is, *
when brethren | live to- | gether · in | unity.
2. It is like fine oil up- | on the | head *
that runs | down up- | on the | beard,
3. Upon the | beard of | Aaron, *
and runs down the | collar | of his | robe.
4. It is like the | dew of | Hermon *
that falls up- | on the | hills of | Zion.
5. For there the LORD has or- | dained the | blessing: *
life | — for | ever- | more.
1. Behold now, bless the LORD, all you | servants · of the | LORD, *
you that stand by | night · in the | house · of the | LORD.
2. Lift up your hands in the holy place and | bless the | LORD; *
the LORD who made heaven and earth | bless you | out of | Zion.
1. Hallelujah! Praise the | Name · of the | LORD; *
give praise, you | servants | of the | LORD,
2. You who stand in the | house · of the | LORD, *
in the courts of the | house | of our | God.
3. Praise the LORD, for the | LORD is | good; *
sing praises to his | Name, for | it is | lovely.
4. For the LORD has chosen Jacob | for him- | self *
and Israel | for his | own pos- | session.
5. For I know that the | LORD is | great; *
and that our Lord | is a- | bove all | gods.
6. The LORD does whatever pleases him, in | heav'n · and on | earth, *
in the | seas and | all the | deeps.
7. He brings up rain clouds from the | ends · of the | earth; *
he sends out lightning with the rain, and brings the | winds out | of his | storehouse.
8. It was he who struck down the | firstborn · of | Egypt, *
the firstborn | both of | man and | beast.
9. He sent signs and wonders into the midst of | you, O | Egypt, *
against | Pharoah | and his | servants.
10. He overthrew | many | nations *
and put | mighty | kings to | death.
11. Sihon, king of the Amorites, and Og, | king of | Bashan, *
and | all the | kingdoms · of | Canaan.
12. He gave their land to | be an · in- | heritace, *
an inheritance | for Is- | rael his | people.
13. O LORD, you Name is | ever- | lasting; *
your renown, O LORD, en- | dures from | age to | age.
14. For the LORD gives his | people | justice *
and shows his com- | passion | to his | servants.
15. The idols of the heathen are | silver · and | gold, *
the | work of | human | hands.
16. They have mouths, but they | cannot | speak; *
eyes have they, | but they | cannot | see.
17. They have ears, but they | cannot | hear; *
neither is there | any | breath · in their | mouth.
18. Those who | make them · are | like them, *
and so are all they that | put their | trust in | them.
19. less the LORD, O | house of | Israel; *
O house of | Aaron, | bless the | LORD.
20. Bless the LORD, O | house of | Levi; *
you who fear the | LORD, | bless the | LORD.
21. Blessed be the LORD | out of | Zion, *
who dwells in Jer- | usa- · lem. | Halle- | lujah.
1. Give thanks to the LORD, for | he is | good, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever.
2. Give thanks to the | God of | gods, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever.
3. Give thanks to the | Lord of | lords, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever.
4. Who only | does great | wonders, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
5. Who by wisdom | made the | heavens, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
6. Who spread out the earth up- | on the | waters, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
7. Who created | great | lights, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
8. The sun to | rule the | day, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
9. The moon and the stars to | govern · the | night, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
10. Who struck down the | firstborn · of | Egypt, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
11. And brought out Israel | from a- | mong them, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
12. With a mighty hand and a | stretched-out | arm, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
13. Who divided the Red | Sea in | two; *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
14. And made Israel to pass through the | midst of | it, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
15. But swept Pharoah and his army | into · the Red | Sea, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
16. Who led his people | through the | wilderness, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
17. Who struck down | great | kings, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
18. And slew | mighty | kings, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
19. Sihon, | king · of the | Amorites, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
20. And Og, | king of | Bashan, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
21. And gave away their lands for | an in- | heritance, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
22. An inheritance for | Israel · his | servant, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
23. Who remembered us in our | low es- | tate, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
24. And delivered us | from our | enemies, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever;
25. Who gives | food to · all | creatures, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever.
26. Give thanks to the | God of | heaven, *
for his | mercy · en- | dures for | ever.
1 By the waters of Babylon we sat | down and | wept, *
when we re- | membered | you, O | Zion.
2 As for our harps, we | hung them | up *
on the trees | in the | midst · of that | land.
3 For those who led us away captive asked us for a song, and our oppressors | called for | mirth: *
"Sing us | one · of the | songs of | Zion."
4 How shall we | sing the | LORD'S song *
up- | on an | alien | soil?
5 If I forget you, | O Je- | rusalem, *
let my right | hand for- | get its | skill.
6 Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if I do | not re- | member you, *
if I do not set Jerusalem a- | bove my | highest | joy.
7 Remember the day of Jerusalem, O LORD, against the | people · of | Edom, *
who said, "Down with it! down with it! | even | to the | ground!"
8 O Daughter of Babylon, | doomed to | destruction, *
happy the one who pays you back for what | you have | done to | us!
9 Happy shall he be who | takes your | little ones, *
and dashes | them a- | gainst the | rock!
1. I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with my | whole | heart; *
before the gods | I will | sing your | praise.
2 I will bow down toward your holy temple and | praise your | Name, *
be- | cause of · your | love and | faithfulness.
3. For you have | glori- · fied your | Name *
and your word a- | bove | all things.
4. When I called, you | answered | me; *
you in- | creased my | strength with- | in me.
5. All the kings of the earth will | praise you, · O | LORD, *
when they have | heard the | words · of your | mouth.
6. They will sing of the | ways · of the | LORD, *
that great is the | glory | of the | LORD.
7. Though the LORD be high, he | cares · for the | lowly; *
he perceives the | haughty | from a- | far.
8. Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you | keep me | safe; *
you stretch forth your hand against the fury of my enemies; | your right | hand shall | save me.
9. The LORD will make good his | purpose | for me; *
O LORD, your love endures for ever; do not abandon the | works | of your | hands.
1. LORD, you have searched me | out and | known me; *
you know my sitting down and my rising up; you dis- | cern my | thoughts from | afar.
2. You trace my journeys and my | resting- | places *
and are ac- | quainted · with | all my | ways.
3. Indeed, there is not a word | on my | lips, *
but you, O LORD, | know it | alto- | gether.
4. You press upon me be- | hind and · be- | fore *
and | lay your | hand up- | on me.
5. Such knowledge is too | wonder- · ful for | me; *
it is so high that I | cannot · at- | tain | to it.
6. Where can I go then | from your | Spirit? *
where can I | flee | from your | presence?
7. If I climb up to heaven, | you are | there; *
if I make the grave my bed, | you are | there | also.
8. If I take the | wings · of the | morning *
and dwell in the | utter- · most | parts · of the | sea,
9. Even there your | hand will | lead me *
and your right | hand | hold me | fast.
10. If I say, "Surely the darkness will | cover | me, *
and the light a- | round me | turn to | night,"
11. Darkness is not dark to you; the night is as | bright · as the | day; *
darkness and light to | you are | both a- | like.
12. For you yourself created my | inmost | parts; *
you knit me together | in my | mother's | womb.
13. I will thank you because I am marvel- | ously | made; *
your works are wonderful, | and I | know it | well.
14. My body was not | hidden | from you, *
while I was being made in secret, and woven | in the | depths · of the earth.
15. Your eyes beheld my limbs, yet unfinished in the womb; all of them were | written | in your | book; *
they were fashioned day by day, when as yet | there was | none of | them.
16. How deep I find your | thoughts, O | God! *
how great | is the | sum of | them.
17. If I were to count them, they would be more in number | than the | sand; *
to count them all, my life span would | need to | be like | yours.
18. Oh, that you would slay the | wicked, · O | God! *
You that thirst for | blood, de- | part from | me.
19. They speak despiteful- | ly a- | gainst you; *
your enemies | take your | Name in | vain.
20. Do I not hate those, O | LORD, who | hate you? *
and do I not loathe those who | rise | up a- | gainst you?
21. I hate them with a | perfect | hatred; *
they have be- | come my | own | enemies.
22. Search me out, O God, and | know my | heart; *
try me and | know my | restless | thoughts.
23. Look well whether there be any | wicked- · ness in | me *
and lead me in the | way · that is | ever- | lasting.
1 How long, O LORD? will you forget me for ever? *
how long will you hide your face from me?
2 How long shall I have perplexity in my mind, and grief in my heart, day after day? *
how long shall my enemy triumph over me?
3 Look upon me and answer me, O LORD my God; *
give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death;
4 Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed over him," *
and my foes rejoice that I have fallen.
5 But I put my trust in your mercy; *
my heart is joyful because of your saving help.
6 I will sing to the LORD, for he has dealt with me richly; *
I will praise the Name of the Lord Most High.
1. Deliver me, O | LORD, from | evildoers; *
pro- | tect me | from the | violent.
2. Who devise evil | in their | hearts *
and | stir up · strife | all day | long.
3. They have sharpened their tongues | like a | serpent; *
adder's | poison · is | under · their | lips.
4. Keep me, O LORD, from the | hands · of the | wicked; *
protect me from the violent, who are de- | termined · to | trip me | up.
5. The proud have hidden a snare for me and stretched out a | net of | cords; *
they have set up traps for | me a- | long the | path.
6. I have said to the LORD, | "You are · my | God;" *
listen, O LORD, | to my | suppli- | cation.
7. O Lord GOD, the | strength of · my sal- | vation, *
you have covered my head | in the | day of | trouble.
8. Do not grant the desires of the | wicked, · O | LORD, *
nor let their | evil | plans | prosper.
9. Let not those who surround me lift | up their | heads; *
let the evil of their | lips | over- | whelm them.
10. Let hot burning coals | fall · upon | them; *
let them be cast into the mire, | never · to | rise · up a- | gain.
11. A slanderer shall not be established | on the | earth, *
and evil | shall hunt | down the | lawless.
12. I know that the LORD will maintain the | cause · of the | poor *
and render | justice | to the | needy.
13. Surely, the righteous will give | thanks · to your | Name, *
and the upright shall con- | tinue | in your | sight.
1. O LORD, I call to you; | come to · me | quickly; *
hear my voice | when I | cry to | you.
2. Let my prayer be set forth in your | sight as | incense, *
the lifting up of my | hands · as the | ev'ning | sacrifice.
3. Set a watch before my mouth, O LORD, and guard the | door · of my | lips; *
let not my heart incline to any | evil | thing.
4. Let me not be occupied in wickedness with | evil- | doers, *
nor | eat of | their choice | foods.
5. Let the righteous smite me in friendly rebuke; let not the oil of the unrighteous an- | oint my | head; *
for my prayer is continually a- | gainst their | wicked | deeds.
6. Let their rulers be overthrown in | stony | places, *
thast they may | know my | words are | true.
7. As when a plowman turns over the | earth in | furrows, *
let their bones be scattered | at the | mouth · of the | grave.
8. But my eyes are turned to | you, Lord | GOD; *
in you I take refuge; do not | strip me | of my | life.
9. Protect me from the snare which they have | laid for | me *
and from the | traps of | evil- | doers.
10. Let the wicked fall into their | own | nets, *
while | I my- | self es- | cape.
1. I cry to the LORD | with my | voice; *
to the LORD I | make loud | suppli- | cation.
2. I pour out my com- | plaint be- | fore him *
and tell him | all my | trouble.
3. When my spirit languishes within me, you | know my | path; *
in the way wherein I walk they have | hidden · a | trap for | me.
4. I look to my right hand and dind no | one who | knows me; *
I have no place to flee to, and | no one | cares for | me.
5. I cry out to | you, O | LORD; *
I say, "You are my refuge, my portion in the | land | of the | living."
6. Listen to my cry for help, for I have been brought | very | low; *
save me from those who pursue me, for they | are too | strong for | me.
7. Bring me out of prison, that I may gives thanks | to your | Name; *
when you have dealt bountifully with me, the | righteous · will | gather · a- | round me.
1. LORD, hear my prayer, and in your faithfulness heed my | suppli- | cations; *
answer me | in your | righteous- | ness.
2. Enter not into judgment | with your | servant, *
for in your sight shall | no one | living · be | justified.
3. For my enemy has sought my life; he has | crushed me · to the | ground; *
he has made me live in dark places like | those · who are | long | dead.
4. My spirit | faints with- | in me; *
my | heart with- | in me · is | desolate.
5. I remember the time past; I muse upon | all your | deeds; *
I con- | sider · the | works · of your | hands.
6. I spread out my | hands to | you; *
my soul gasps to you | like a | thirsty | land.
7. O LORD, make haste to answer me; my | spirit | fails me; *
do not hide your face from me or I shall be like those who | go down | to the | Pit.
8. Let me hear of your loving-kindness in the morning, for I put my | trust in | you; *
show me the road that I must walk, for I lift | up my | soul to | you.
9. Deliver me from my | enemies, · O | LORD, *
for I | free to | you for | refuge.
10. Teach me to do what pleases you, for | you are · my | God; *
let your good spirit | lead me · on | level | ground.
11. Revive me, O LORD, for your | Name's | sake; *
for your righteousness sake, | bring me | out of | trouble.
12. Of your goodness, destroy my enemies and bring all my | foes to | naught, *
for | truly | I am · your | servant.
1. Blessed be the | LORD my | rock! *
who trains my hands to fight | and my | fingers · to | battle;
2. My help and my fortress, my stronghold and | my de- | liverer, *
my shield in whom I trust, who sub- | dues the | peoples | under me.
3. O LORD, what are we that | you should | care for us? *
mere mortals that | you should | think of | us?
4. We are like a | puff of | wind; *
our days are | like a | passing | shadow.
5. Bow your heavens, O | LORD, · and come | down; *
touch the | mountains, · and | they shall | smoke.
6. Hurl the | lightning · and | scatter them; *
shoot | out your | arrows · and | rout them.
7. Stretch out your | hand · from on | high; *
rescue me and deliver me from the great waters, from the | hand of | foreign | peoples,
8. Whose mouths | speak de- | ceitfully *
and whose right | hand is | raised in | falsehood.
9. O God, I will sing to | you a · new | song; *
I will play to you | on a | ten-stringed | lyre.
10. You give | victory · to | kings *
and have | rescued | David · your | servant.
11. Rescue me from the | hurtful | sword *
and deliver me from the | hand of | foreign | peoples,
12. Whose mouths | speak de- | ceitfully *
and whose right | hand is | raised in | falsehood.
13. May our sons be like plants well | nurtured · from their | youth, *
and our daughters like sculptured | corners | of a | palace.
14. May our barns be filled to overflowing with all | manner · of | crops; *
may the flocks in our pastures increase by thousands and tens of thousands; and may our | cattle · be | fat and | sleek.
15. May there be no breaching of the walls, no | going · into | exile, *
no wailing | in the | public | squares.
16. Happy are the people of whom | this is | so! *
happy are the people whose | God | is the | LORD!
1. I will exalt you, O | God my | King, *
and bless your Name for ever.
2. Every day | will I | bless you *
and praise your | Name for | ever · and | ever.
3. Great is the LORD and | greatly · to be | praised; *
there is | no end | to his | greatness.
4. One generation shall praise your | works · to an- | other *
and | shall de- | clare your | power.
5. I will ponder the glorious | splendor · of your | majesty *
and | all your | marvel- · ous | works.
6. They shall speak of the might of your | wondrous | acts, *
and | I will | tell · of your | greatness.
7. They shall publish the remembrance of | your great | goodness; *
they shall | sing of · your | righteous | deeds.
8. The LORD is gracious and | full of · com- | passion, *
slow to | anger · and | of great | kindness.
9. The LORD is | loving · to | everyone *
and his compassion is | over | all his | works.
10. All your works | praise you, · O | LORD, *
and your | faithful | servants | bless you.
11. They make known the | glory · of your | kingdom *
and | speak | of your | power.
12. That the peoples may | know of · your power *
and the glorious | splendor | of your | kingdom.
13. Your kingdom is an ever- | lasting | kingdom; *
your dominion en- | dures through- | out all | ages.
14. The LORD is faithful in | all his | words *
and | merci- · ful in | all his | deeds.
15. The LORD upholds all | those who | fall; *
he lifts up | those who | are bowed | down.
16. The eyes of all wait upon | you, O | LORD, *
and you give them their | food | in due | season.
17. You open | wide your | hand *
and satisfy the needs of | ev'ry | living | creature.
18. The LORD is righteous in | all his | ways *
and | loving · in | all his | works.
19. The LORD is near to those who | call up- | on him, *
to all who | call up- | on him | faithfully.
20. He fulfills the desire of | those who | fear him; *
he | hears their | cry and | helps them.
21. The LORD preserves all | those who | love him, *
but he de- | stroys | all the | wicked.
22. My mouth shall speak the | praise · of the | LORD; *
let all flesh bless his | Name for | ever · and | ever.
1. Hallelujah! Praise the LORD, | O my | soul! *
I will praise the LORD as long as I live; I will sing praises to my God | while I | have my | being.
2. Put not your turst in rulers, nor in any | child of | earth, *
for | there is | no help | in them.
3. When they breathe their last, they re- | turn to | earth, *
and in that | day their | thoughts | perish.
4. Happy are they who have the God of Jacob | for their | help! *
whose hope is | in the | LORD their | God:
5. Who made heaven and earth, the seas, and | all · that is | in them; *
who | keeps his | promise · for | ever;
6. Who gives justice to those | who · are op- | pressed, *
and | food to | those who | hunger.
7. The LORD sets the prisoners free; the LORD opens the | eyes · of the | blind; *
the LORD lifts up | those who | are bowed | down
8. The LORD loves the righteous; the LORD | cares · for the | stranger; *
he sustains the orphan and widow, but frus- | trates the | way · of the | wicked.
9. The LORD shall | reign for | ever, *
your God, O Zion, throughout all gener- | ations. Halle- | lujah!
1. Hallelujah! How good it is to sing | praises · to our | God! *
how pleasant it is to | honor | him with | praise!
2. The LORD | rebuilds | Jerusalem; *
he | gathers · the | exiles · of | Israel.
3. He heals the | broken- | hearted *
and | binds | up their | wounds.
4. He counts the | number · of the | stars *
and calls them | all | by their | names.
5. Great is our LORD and | mighty · in | power; *
there is no | limit | to his | wisdom.
6. The LORD | lifts up · the | lowly, *
but casts the | wicked | to the | ground.
7. Sing to the LORD | with thanks- | giving; *
make music to our | God up- | on the | harp.
8. He covers the | heavens · with | clouds *
and pre- | pares rain | for the | earth.
9. He makes grass to | grow up- · on the | mountains *
and green | plants to | serve man- | kind.
10. He provides food for | flocks and | herds *
and for the young | ravens | when they | cry.
11. He is not impressed by the | might · of a | horse; *
he has no | pleasure · in the | strength · of a | man.
12. But the LORD has pleasure in | those who | fear him *
in those who a- | wait his | gracious | favor.
13. Worship the LORD, | O Jer- | usalem; *
praise | — your | God, O | Zion;
14. For he has strengthened the | bars · of your | gates; *
he has | blessed · your | children · with- | in you.
15. He has established | peace · on your | borders; *
he satisfies you | with the | finest | wheat.
16. He sends out his command | to the | earth, *
and his | word runs | very | swiftly.
17. He gives | snow like | wool; *
he | scatters | hoarfrost · like | ashes.
18. He scatters his | hail like | bread crumbs; *
who can | stand a- | gainst his | cold?
19. He sends forth his | word and | melts them; *
he blows with his wind, | and the | waters | flow.
20. He declares his | word to | Jacob, *
his statutes | and his | judgments · to | Israel.
21. He has not done so to | any · other | nation; *
to them he has not revealed his | judgments. | Halle- | lujah!
1. Hallelujah! Praise the LORD | from the | heavens; *
praise | — him | in the | heights.
2. Praise him, all you | angels · of | his; *
praise him, all his host.
3. Praise him, sun and moon; *
praise | — him, | all you | shining stars.
4. Praise him, | heav'n of | heavens, *
and you | waters · a- | bove the | heavens.
5. Let them praise the | Name · of the | LORD; *
for he commanded, | and they | were cre- | ated.
6. He made them stand fast for | ever · and | ever; *
he gave them a law which | shall not | pass a- | way.
7. Praise the LORD | from the | earth, *
you | sea- · monsters | and all | deeps.
8. Fire and hail, | snow and | fog, *
tempestuous | wind, | doing · his | will;
9. Monsters | and all | hills, *
fruit | trees and | all | cedars.
10. Wild beasts and | all | cattle, *
creeping | things and | winged | birds;
11. Kings of the earth and | all | peoples, *
princes and all | rulers | of the | world;
12. Young | men and | maidens, *
old | — and | young to- | gether.
13. Let them praise the | Name · of the | LORD, *
for his Name only is exalted, his splendor is | over | earth and | heaven.
14. He has raised up strength for his people and praise for all his | loyal | servants, *
the children of Israel, a people who are | near him. | Halle- | lujah!
1. Hallelujah! Sing to the LORD a | new | song: *
sing his praise in the congreg- | ation | of the | faithful.
2. Let Israel re- | joice · in his | Maker; *
let the children of Zion be | joyful | in their | King.
3. Let them praise his | Name · in the | dance; *
let them sing praise to him with | tim- | brel and | harp.
4. For the LORD takes pleasure | in his | people *
and ad- | orns the | poor with | victory.
5. Let the faithful re- | joice in | triumph; *
let them be | joyful | on their beds.
6. Let the praises of God | be · in their | throat *
and a two-edged | sword | in their | hand.
7. To wreak | vengeance · on the | nations *
and | punish- · ment | on the | peoples.
8. To bind their | kings in | chains *
and their | nobles · with | links of | iron;
9. To inflict on them the | judgment · de- | creed; *
this is glory for all his faithful | people. | Halle- | lujah!
1. The fool has said in his heart, "There | is no | God." *
All are corrupt and commit abominable acts; there is | none who | does · any | good.
2. The LORD looks down from heaven up- | on us | all, *
to see if there is any who is wise, if there is | one who | seeks · after | God.
3. Every one has proved faithless; all alike | have turned | bad; *
there is none who | does good; | no, not | one.
4. Have they no knowledge, all those | evil- | doers *
who eat up my people like bread and do not | call up- | on the | LORD?
5. See how they | tremble · with | fear, *
because God is in the | compa- · ny | of the | righteous.
6. Their aim is to confound the plans | of · the af- | flicted, *
but the | LORD | is their | refuge.
7. Oh, that Israel's deliverance would come | out of | Zion! *
when the LORD restores the fortunes of his people, Jacob will re- | joice and | Israel · be | glad.
1 Hallelujah! Praise God in his | holy | temple; *
praise him in the | firma- · ment | of his | power.
2 Praise him for his | mighty | acts; *
praise him | for his | excell- · ent | greatness.
3 Praise him with the | blast · of the | ram's-horn; *
praise | him with | lyre and | harp.
4 Praise him with | timbrel · and | dance; *
praise | him with | strings and | pipe.
5 Praise him with re- | sounding | cymbals; *
praise | him with | loud- · clanging | cymbals.
6 Let everything | that has | breath *
praise the Lord. | Halle- | lu- | jah!
1 LORD, who may | dwell in · your | tabernacle? *
who may abide up- | on your | holy | hill?
2 Whoever leads a blameless life and does | what is | right, *
who speaks the | truth | from his | heart.
3 There is no guile upon his tongue; he does no evil | to his | friend; *
he does not heap con- | tempt up- | on his | neighbor.
4 In his sight the wicked | is re- | jected, *
but he honors | those who | fear the | LORD.
5 He has sworn to | do no | wrong *
and does | not take | back his | word.
6 He does not give his money in | hope of | gain, *
nor does he take a | bribe a- | gainst the | innocent.
7 Whoever | does these | things *
shall | never · be | over- | thrown.
1. Protect me, O God, for I take | refuge | in you; *
I have said to the LORD, "You are my Lord, my | good a- | bove all | other."
2. All my delight is upon the godly that | are · in the | land, *
upon those who are | noble · a- | mong the | people.
3. But those who run after | other | gods *
shall have their | troubles | multi- | plied.
4. Their libations of blood I | will not | offer, *
nor take the names of their | gods up- | on my | lips.
5. O LORD, you are my | portion · and my | cup; *
it is you | who up- | hold my | lot.
6. My boundaries enclose a | pleasant | land; *
indeed, | I have a | goodly | heritage.
7. I will bless the LORD who | gives me | counsel; *
my heart teaches me, | night | after | night.
8. I have set the LORD | always · be- | fore me; *
because he is at my right | hand I | shall not | fall.
9. My heart, therefore, is glad, and my | spirit | rejoices; *
my body | also · shall | rest in | hope.
10. For you will not a- | bandon · me | to the | grave, *
nor let your | holy · one | see the | Pit.
11. You will show me the | path of | life; *
in your presence there is fullness of joy, and in your right hand are | pleasures · for | ever- | more.
1. Hear my cry of innocence, O LORD; give | heed · to my | cry; *
listen to my prayer, which does not | come from | lying | lips.
2. Let my vindication come forth | from your | presence; *
let your | eyes be | fixed on | justice.
3. Weight my heart, | summon · me by | night, *
melt me down; you will find | no im- | puri- · ty | in me.
4. I give no offense with my mouth as | others | do; *
I have heeded the | words · of your | lips.
5. My footsteps hold fast to the | ways · of your | law; *
in your paths my | feet | shall not | stumble.
6. I call upon you, O God, for | you will | answer me; *
incline your ear to | me and | hear my | words.
7. Show me your marvelous | loving- | kindness, *
O Savior of those who take refuge at your right hand from | those who · rise | up a- | gainst them.
8. Keep me as the | apple · of your | eye; *
hide me | under · the | shadow · of your | wings,
9. From the wicked | who as- | sault me, *
from my deadly | ene- · mies | who sur- | round me.
10. They have closed their | heart to | pity, *
and their | mouth speaks | proud | things.
11. They press me hard, now they | surround | me, *
watching how they may | cast me | to the | ground,
12. Like a lion, | greedy · for its | prey, *
and like a young lion | lurking · in | secret | places.
13. Arise, O LORD; confront them and | bring them | down; *
deliver me from the | wicked | by your | sword.
14. Deliver me, O LORD, | by your | hand *
from those whose portion in | life | is this | world;
15. Whose bellies you | fill · with your | treasure, *
who are well supplied with children and leave their | wealth · to their | little | ones.
16. But at my vindication I shall | see your | face; *
when I awake, I shall be | satis- · fied, be- | holding · your | likeness.
1. I love you, O | LORD, my | strength, *
O LORD, my stronghold, my | crag, | and my | haven.
2. My God, my rock in whom I | put my | trust, *
my shield, the horn of my salvation, and refuge; | you are | worthy · of | praise.
3. I will call up- | on the | LORD, *
and so I | shall be | saved · from my | enemies.
4. The breakers of death | rolled · over | me, *
and the torrents of oblivion | made me | afraid.
5. The cords of death en- | tangled | me, *
and the snares of | death were | set for | me.
6. I called upon the the LORD | in my | distress *
and cried out | to my | God for | help.
7. He heard my voice from his | heavenly | dwelling; *
my cry of | anguish | came · to his | ears.
8. The earth | reeled and | rocked; *
the roots of the mountains shook; they | reeled be- | cause · of his | anger.
9. Smoke rose from his nostrils and a consuming fire | out of · his | mouth; *
hot burning | coals blazed | forth from | him.
10. He parted the heavens and | came | down *
with a storm and | cloud | under · his | feet.
11. He mounted on cheru- | bim and | flew; *
he | swooped · on the | wings · of the | cloud.
12. He wrapped | darkness · a- | bout him; *
he made dark waters and | thick clouds | his pa- | vilion.
13. From the brightness of his presence, | through the | clouds, *
burst | hailstones · and | coals of | fire.
14. The LORD thundered | out of | heaven; *
the | Most High | uttered · his | voice.
15. He loosed his | arrows · and | scattered them; *
he hurled | thunder- · bolts | and · routed | them.
16. The beds of seas were ubcovered, and the foundations of the | world laid | bare, *
at your battle cry, O LORD, at the | blast · of the | breath · of your | nostrils.
17. He reached down form on | high and | grasped me; *
he drew me | out of | great | waters.
18. He delivered me from mt strong enemies and from | those who | hated me; *
for they | were too | mighty | for me.
19. They confronted me in the | day of · my | disaster; *
but the | LORD was | my sup- | port.
20. He brought me out into an | open | place; *
he rescued me be- | cause he | delight- · ed | in me.
21. The LORD rewarded me because of my | righteous | dealing; *
because my | hands were | clean he | rewarded me.
22. For I have kept the | ways · of the | LORD *
and have not of- | fended · a- | gainst my | God;
23. For all his judgments are be- | fore my | eyes, *
and his decrees I have not | put a- | way from | me.
24. For I have been | blameless · with | him *
and therefore | kept my- | self · from in- | iquity.
25. Therefore the LORD rewarded me according to his | righteous | dealing, *
because of the cleanness of my | hands | in his | sight.
26. With the faithful you show yourself | faithful, · O | God; *
with the | forthright · you | show your- · self | forthright.
27. With the pure you | show your- · self | pure, *
but with the | crooked | you are | wily.
28. You will save a | lowly | people, *
but you will | humble · the | haughty | eyes.
29. You, O LORD, | are my | lamp; *
my God, you | make my | darkness | bright.
30. With you I will break | down an · en- | closure; *
and with the help of my God I will | scale | any | wall.
31. As for God, his ways are perfect; the words of the LORD are | tried · in the | fire; *
he is a shield to | all who | trust in | him.
32. For who is God, | but the | LORD? *
who is the | Rock, ex- | cept our | God?
33. It is God who girds me | about · with | strength *
and | makes my | way se- | cure.
34. He makes me | sure-footed · as a | deer *
and lets me stand | firm | on the | heights.
35. He trains my | hands for | battle *
and my arms for bending | even · a | bow of | bronze.
36. You have given me your | shield of | victory; *
your right hand also sustains me; and your loving | care | makes me | great.
37. You lengthen my | stride be- | neath me, *
and my | ankles | do not · give | way.
38. I pursue my enemies and | overtake | them; *
I will not turn back | till I | have des- | troyed them.
39. I strike them down, and they | cannot | rise; *
they fall de- | feated | at my | feet.
40. You have girded me with | strength · for the | battle; *
you have cast down my adversaries beneath me; you have | put my | ene- · mies to | flight.
41. I will destroy those who hate me; they cry out, but there is | none to | help them; *
they cry to the LORD, | but he | does not | answer.
42. I beat them like dust be- | fore the | wind; *
I trample them like | mud · in the | streets.
43. You deliver me from the | strife · of the | peoples; *
you put me | at the | head · of the | nations.
44. A people I have not known shall serve me; no sooner shall they hear than they | shall o- | bey me; *
strangers will | cringe | before | me.
45. The foreign peoples | will lose | heart; *
they shall come | trembling | out of · their | strongholds.
46. The LORD lives! | Blessed · is my | Rock! *
Exalted is the | God of | my sal- | vation!
47. He is the God who | gave me | victory *
and cast | down the | peoples · be- | neath me.
48. You rescued me from the fury of my enemies; you exalted me above those who | rose a- | gainst me; *
you saved me | from my | deadly | foe.
49. Therefore will I extol you among the | nations, · O | LORD, *
and sing | praises to | your | Name.
50. He multiplies the | victories · of his | king; *
he shows loving-kindness to his anointed, to David and | his des- | cendents · for | ever.
1. Happy are they who have not walked in the | counsel · of the | wicked *
nor lingered in the way of sinners, nor sat in the | seats | of the | scornful!
2. Their delight is in the | law · of the | LORD, *
and they meditate on his | law | day and | night.
3. They are like trees planted by streams of water, bearing fruit in due season, with leaves that | do not | wither *
every- | thing they | do shall | prosper.
4. It is not so | with the | wicked; *
they are like chaff which the | wind | blows a- | way.
5. Therefore the wicked shall not upright when | judgment | comes *
nor the sinner in the | council | of the | righteous.
6. For the LORD knows the | way · of the | righteous, *
but the way of the | wick- | ed is | doomed.
1. May the LORD answer you in the | day of | trouble, *
the Name of the God of | Ja- | cob de- | fend you;
2. Send you help from his | holy | place *
and | strengthen · you | out of | Zion.
3. Remember | all your | offerings *
and ac- | cept your | burnt | sacrifice;
4. Grand you your | heart's de- | sire *
and | prosper | all your | plans.
5. We will shout for joy at your victory and triumph in the | Name of · our | God; *
may the LORD | grant all | your re- | quests.
6. Now that I know that the LORD gives victory to | his an- | ointed: *
he will answer them out of his holy heaven, with the victorious | strength of | his right | hand.
7. Some put their trust in chariots and | some in | horses, *
but we will call upon the | Name · of the | LORD our | God.
8. They collapse and | fall | down, *
but we will a- | rise and | stand up- | right.
9. O LORD, give victory | to the | king *
and | answer · us | when we | call.
1. The king rejoices in your | strength, O | LORD; *
how greatly | he ex- | ults · in your | victory!
2. You have given him his | heart's de- | sire; *
you have not denied | him · the re- | quest · of his | lips.
3. For you meet him with | blessings · of pros- | perity, *
and set a crown of fine | gold up- | on his | head.
4. He asked your for life, and you | gave it | to him: *
length of days, | for ev- | er and | ever.
5. His honor is great, be- | cause of · your | victory; *
splendor and majesty have you bestowed upon him.
6. For you will give him ever- | lasting · fel- icity *
and will make him glad with the | joy | of your | presence.
7. For the king puts his | trust · in the | LORD; *
because of the loving-kindness of the Most | High, he | will not | fall.
8. Your hand will lay hold upon | all your | enemies; *
your right hand will | seize all | those who | hate you.
9. You will make them like a | fiery | furnace *
at the time of | your ap- | pearing, · O | LORD;
10. You will swallow them | up · in your | wrath, *
and | fire | shall con- | sume them.
11. Your will destroy their | offspring · from the | land *
and their descendents from among the | peoples | of the | earth.
12. Though they intend evil against you and devise | wicked | schemes, *
yet | they shall | not pre- | vail.
13. For you will | put them · to | flight *
and | aim your | arrows | at them.
14. Be exalted, O | LORD, · in your | might; *
we will | sing and | praise your | power.
1 My God, my God, why have | you for- | saken me? *
and are so far from my cry and from the | words of | my dis- | tress?
2 O my God, I cry in the daytime, but you | do not | answer; *
by night as well, | but I | find no | rest.
3 Yet you are the | Holy | One, *
enthroned up- | on the | praises · of | Israel.
4 Our forefathers put their | trust in | you; *
they trusted, and | you de- | livered | them.
5 They cried out to you and | were de- | livered; *
they trusted in you and | were not | put to | shame.
6 But as for me, I am a | worm and no | man, *
scorned by all and de- | spised | by the | people.
7 All who see me | laugh me · to | scorn; *
they curl their lips and | wag their | heads, | saying,
8 "He trusted in the LORD; let | him de- | liver him; *
let him rescue him, if | he de- | lights in | him."
9 Yet you are he who took me | out of · the | womb, *
and kept me safe up- | on my | mother's | breast.
10 I have been entrusted to you ever since | I was | born; *
you were my God when I was still | in my | mother's | womb.
11 Be not far from me, for | trouble · is | near, *
and | there is | none to | help.
12 Many young | bulls en- | circle me; *
strong | bulls of | Bashan · sur- | round me.
13 They open wide their | jaws at | me, *
like a ravening | and a | roaring | lion.
14 I am poured out like water; all my bones are | out of | joint; *
my heart within my | breast is | melting | wax.
15 My mouth is dried out like a pot-sherd; my tongue sticks to the | roof · of my | mouth; *
and you have laid me | in the | dust · of the | grave.
16 Packs of dogs close me in, and gangs of evildoers | circle · a- | round me; *
they pierce my hands and my feet; I can | count | all my | bones.
17 They stare | and gloat | over me; *
they divide my garments among them; they cast | lots | for my | clothing.
18 Be not far a- | way, O | LORD; *
you are my strength; | hast- | en to | help me.
19 Save me | from the | sword, *
my life from the | power | of the | dog.
20 Save me from the | lion's | mouth, *
my wretched body from the | horns of | wild | bulls.
21 I will declare your | Name · to my | brethren; *
in the midst of the congre- | gation | I will | praise you.
22 Praise the LORD, | you that | fear him; *
stand in awe of him, O offspring of Israel; all you of | Jacob's | line, give | glory.
23 For he does not despise nor abhor the poor in their poverty; neither does he hide his | face from | them; *
but when they | cry to | him he | hears them.
24 My praise is of him in the | great as- | sembly; *
I will perform my vows in the presence of | those who | worship | him.
25 The poor shall eat and be satisfied, and those who seek the | LORD shall | praise him: *
"May your | heart | live for | ever!"
26 All the ends of the earth shall remember and | turn · to the | LORD, *
and all the families of the | nations | bow be- | fore him.
27 For kingship be- | longs · to the | LORD; *
he | rules | over · the | nations.
28 To him alone all who sleep in the earth bow | down in | worship; *
all who go down to the | dust | fall be- | fore him.
29 My soul shall live for him; my des- | cendants · shall | serve him; *
they shall be | known · as the | LORD'S for | ever.
30 They shall come and make known to a people yet unborn *
the saving deeds that he has done.
1. The | LORD · is my | shepherd; *
I | shall not | be in | want.
2. He makes me lie down in | green | pastures *
and | leads me · be- | side still | waters.
3. He re- | vives my | soul *
and guides me along right | pathways | for his | Name's sake.
4. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of feath I shall | fear no | evil; *
for you are with me; your rod and your | staff, they | comfort | me.
5. You spread a table before me in the presence of | those who | trouble me; *
you have anointed my head with oil and my | cup is | running | over.
6. Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me all the | days of · my | life, *
and I will dwell in the | house · of the | LORD for | ever.
1 The earth is the LORD'S and | all · that is | in it, *
the world and | all who | dwell there- | in.
2 For it is he who founded it up- | on the | seas *
and made it firm upon the | rivers | of the | deep.
3 "Who can ascend the | hill · of the | LORD? *
and who can stand | in his | holy | place?"
4 "Those who have clean hands and a | pure | heart, *
who have not pledged themselves to falsehood, nor | sworn by | what · is a | fraud.
5 They shall receive a | blessing · from the | LORD *
and a just reward from the | God of | their sal- | vation."
6 Such is the generation of | those who | seek him, *
of those who seek your | face, O | God of | Jacob.
7. Lift up your heads, O gates; lift them high, O ever- | lasting | doors; *
and the King of | glory | shall come | in.
8. "Who is this | King of | glory?" *
"The LORD, strong and mighty, the | LORD, | mighty · in | battle."
9 Lift up your heads, O gates; lift them high, O ever- | lasting | doors; *
and the King of | glory | shall come | in.
10 "Who is he, this | King of | glory?" *
"The LORD of hosts, | he · is the | King of | glory."
1. To you, O LORD, I lift up my soul; my God, I put my | trust in | you; *
let me not humiliated, nor let my enemies | triumph | over | me.
2. Let none who look to you be | put to | shame; *
let the treacherous be disap- | pointed | in their | schemes.
3. Show me your | ways, O | LORD, *
and | teach | me your | paths.
4. Lead me in your | truth and | teach me, *
for you are the God of my salvation; in you have I trusted | all the | day | long.
5. Remember, O LORD, your com- | passion · and | love, *
for they | are from | ever- | lasting.
6. Remember not the sins of my youth and | my trans- | gressions; *
remember me according to your love, and for the sake of your | good- | ness, O | LORD.
7. Gracious and upright | is the | LORD; *
therefore he teaches | sinners | in his | way.
8. He guides the humble in | doing | right *
and teaches his | way | to the | lowly.
9. All the paths of the LORD are | love and | faithfulness *
to those who keep his | cove- · nant | and his | testimonies.
10. For your Name's | sake, O | LORD, *
forgive my | sin, for | it is | great.
11. Who are they who | fear the | LORD? *
he will teach them the | way that | they should | choose.
12. They shall dwell | in pros- | perity, *
and their offspring | shall in- | herit · the | land.
13. The LORD is a friend to | those who | fear him *
and | will · show them | his cov- | enant.
14. My eyes are ever looking | to the | LORD, *
for he shall pluck my | feet out | of the | net.
15. Turn to me and have | pity · on | me, *
for I am left a- | lone | and in | misery.
16. The sorrows of my heart | have in- | creased; *
bring me | out | of my | troubles.
17. Look upon my | adversi- · ty and | misery *
and for- | give me | all my | sin.
18. Look upon my enemies, for | they are | many, *
and they bear a | violent | hatred · a- | gainst me.
19. Protect my life and de- | liver | me; *
let me not be put to shame, for | I have | trusted · in | you.
20. Let integrity and uprightness | preserve | me, *
for my | hope has | been in | you.
21. Deliver | Israel, · O | God, *
out of | all | his | troubles.
1. Give judgment for me, O LORD, for I have lived | with in- | tegrity; *
I have trusted in the | Lord and | have not | faltered.
2. Test me, O | LORD, and | try me; *
examine my | heart | and my | mind.
3. For your love is be- | fore my | eyes; *
I have walked | faithful- | ly with | you.
4. I have not sat | with the | worthless, *
nor do I con- | sort with | the de- | ceitful.
5. I have hated the company of | evi- | ldoers; *
I will not | sit down | with the | wicked.
6. I will wash my hands in | inno- · cence, O | LORD, *
that I may go in pro- | cession | round your | altar.
7. Singing aloud a | song of · thanks- | giving *
and recounting | all your | wonder- · ful | deeds.
8. LORD, I love the house in | which I | dwell *
and the place | where your | glory · a- | bides.
9. Do not sweep me a- | way with | sinners, *
nor my life with | those who | thirst for | blood,
10. Whose hands are full of | evil | plots, *
and their | right hand | full of | bribes.
11. As for me, I will live | with in- | tegrity; *
redeem me, O LORD, | and have | pity · on | me.
12. My foot stands on | level | ground; *
in the full assembly | I will | bless the | LORD.
1. The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom then | shall I | fear? *
the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom then | shall I | be a- | fraid.
2. When evildoers came upon me to eat | up my | flesh, *
it was they, my foes and my advers- | aries, · who | stumbled · and | fell.
3. Though an army should en- | camp a- | gainst me, *
yet my heart | shall not | be a- | fraid;
4. And though was should rise | up a- | gainst me, *
yet will I | put my | trust in | him.
5. One thing I have asked of the LORD; one | thing I | seek; *
that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the | days | of my | life;
6. To behold the fair | beauty · of the | LORD *
to | seek him | in his | temple.
7. For in the day of trouble he shall keep me | safe · in his | shelter; *
he shall hide me in the secrecy of his dwelling and set me | high up- | on a | rock.
8. Even now he lifts | up my | head *
and my | ene- · mies | round a- | bout me.
9. Therefore I will offer in his dwelling an oblation with sounds of | great | gladness; *
I will sing and make | music | to the | LORD.
10. Hearken to my voice, O LORD, | when I | call; *
have mercy on | me and | answer | me.
11. You speak in my heart and say seek, | "Seek my | face." *
Your | face, LORD, | will I | seek.
12. Hide not your | face from | me, *
nor turn away your | servant | in dis- | pleasure.
13. You have been my helper; cast me | not a- | way; *
do not forsake me, O | God of | my sal- | vation.
14. Though my father and my | mother · for- | sake me, *
the | LORD | will sus- | tain me.
15. Show me you | way, O | LORD; *
lead me on a level path, be- | cause | of my | enemies.
16. Deliver me not into the | hand of · my | adversaries, *
for false witnesses have risen up against me, and also | those who | speak | malice.
17. What if I had not believed that I should see the | goodness · of the | LORD *
in the | land | of the | living.
18. O tarry and await the LORD's pleasure; be strong, and | he shall | comfort — | your heart; *
wait | patient- · ly | for the | LORD.
1. O LORD, I call to you; my Rock, do not be deaf | to my | cry; *
lest, if you do not hear me, I become like those who go | down in- | to the | Pit.
2. Hear the voice of my prayer when I cry | out to | you, *
when I lift up my | hands · to your | holy · of | holies.
3. Do not snatch me away with the wicked or with the | evil- | doers, *
who speak peaceably with their neighbors, while | strife is | in their | hearts.
4. Repay them according to the work of their hands | and re- | pay them, *
and according to the | wicked- · ness | of their | actions.
5. According to the work of their | hands re- | pay them, *
and give | them their | just de- | serts.
6. They have no understanding of the LORD's doings, nor of the | works · of his | hands; *
therefore he will break them down and | not | build them | up.
7. Blessed | is the | LORD! *
for he has heard the | voice · of my | prayer.
8. The LORD is my | strength · and my | shield; *
my heart trusts in him, | and I | have been | helped.
9. Therefore my heart | dances · for | joy, *
and in my | song | will I | praise him.
10. The LORD is the | strength · of his | people, *
a safe | refuge · for | his an- | ointed.
11. Save your people and | bless · your in- | heritance; *
shepherd them and | carry | them for | ever.
1 Ascribe to the | LORD, you | gods, *
ascribe to the | LORD | glory · and | strength.
2 Ascribe to the LORD the | glory · due his | Name; *
worship the | LORD · in the | beauty · of | holiness.
3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters; the God of | glory | thunders; *
the LORD is up- | on the | mighty | waters.
4 The voice of the LORD is a | power- · ful | voice; *
the voice of the LORD | is a | voice of | splendor.
5 The voice of the LORD | breaks the | cedar trees; *
the LORD | breaks the | cedars · of | Lebanon;
6 He makes Lebanon | skip · like a | calf, *
and Mount Hermon | like a | young wild | ox.
7 The voice of the LORD splits the flames of fire; the voice of the LORD | shakes the | wilderness; *
the LORD shakes the | wilder- | ness of | Kadesh.
8 The voice of the LORD makes the | oak trees | writhe *
and | strips the | forests | bare.
9 And in the | temple · of the | LORD *
all are | crying, | "Glo- | ry!"
10 The LORD sits enthroned a- | bove the | flood; *
the LORD sits enthroned as | King for | ever- | more.
11 The LORD shall give | strength · to his | people; *
the LORD shall give his | people · the | blessing · of | peace.
1 Why are the nations | in an | uproar? *
Why do the peoples | mutter | empty | threats?
2 Why do the kings of the earth rise up in revolt, and the princes | plot to- | gether, *
against the LORD and a- | gainst | his An- | ointed?
3 "Let us break their | yoke," they | say; *
"let us cast | off their | bonds from | us."
4 He whose throne is in | heaven · is | laughing; *
the Lord | has them | in der- | ision.
5 Then he speaks to them | in his | wrath, *
and his | rage | fills them · with | terror.
6 "I myself have | set my | king *
upon my | holy | hill of | Zion."
7 Let me announce the de- | cree · of the | LORD: *
he said to me, "You are my Son; this | day have | I be- | gotten you.
8 Ask of me, and I will give you the nations for | your in- | heritance *
and the ends of the | earth for | your pos- | session.
9 You shall crush them with an | iron | rod *
and shatter them | like a | piece of | pottery."
10 And now, you | kings, be | wise; *
be warned, you | rulers | of the | earth.
11 Submit to the | LORD with | fear, *
and | with trem- | bling bow | before him;
12 Lest he be angry | and you | perish; *
for his | wrath is | quickly | kindled.
1. I will exalt you, O LORD, because you have | lifted · me | up *
and have not let my enemies | triumph | over | me.
2. O LORD my God, I cried | out to | you, *
and | you re- | stored · me to | health.
3. You brought me up, O LORD, | from the | dead; *
you restored my life as I was going down to the grave.
4. Sing to the LORD, you | servants · of | his; *
give thanks for the re- | membrance | of his | holiness.
5. For his wrath endures but the | twinkling · of an | eye, *
his | favor | for a | lifetime.
6. Weeping may | spend the | night, *
but | joy comes | in the | morning.
7. While I felt secure, I said, "I shall never | be dis- | turbed. *
You, LORD, with your favor, made me as | strong | as the | mountains."
8. Then you | hid your | face, *
and | I was | filled with | fear.
9. I cried to | you, O | LORD; *
I pleaded | with the | LORD, | saying.
10. "What profit is there in my blood, if I go | down · to the | Pit? *
will the dust praise you | or de- | clare your | faithfulness?
11. Hear, O LORD, and have | mercy · up- | on me; *
O | LORD, | be my | helper."
12. You have turned my wailing | into | dancing; *
you have put off my sack-cloth | and clothed | me with | joy.
13. Therefore my heart sings to you | without | ceasing; *
O LORD my God, I will | give you | thanks for | ever.
1. In you, O LORD, have I taken refuge; let me never be | put to | shame; *
de- | liver · me | in your | righteousness.
2. Incline your | ear to | me; *
make | haste | to de- | liver me.
3. Be my strong rock, a castle to keep me safe, for you are my | crag · and my | stronghold; *
for the sake of your | Name, | lead me · and | guide me.
4. Take me out of the net that they have secretly | laid for | me, *
for you | are my | tow'r of | strength.
5. Into your hands I com- | mend my | spirit, *
for you have redeemed me, | O LORD, | O God of | truth.
6. I hate those who cling to | worthless | idols, *
and I | put my | trust · in the | LORD.
7. I will rejoice and be glad be- | cause of · your | mercy; *
for you have seen my af- | fliction; · you | know · my dis- | tress.
8. You have not shut me up in the | power · of the | enemy; *
you have set my feet | in an | open | place.
9. Have mercy on me, O LORD, for | I am · in | trouble; *
my eye is consumed with sorrow, and | also · my | throat · and my | belly.
10. For my life is wasted with grief, and my | years with | sighing; *
my strength fails me because of affliction, and my | bones | are con- | sumed.
11. I have become a reproach to all my enemies and even to my neighbors, a dismay to those of | my ac- | quaintance; *
when they see me in the | street | they a- | void me.
12. I am forgotten like a dead man, | out of | mind; *
I am as useless | as a | broken | pot.
13. For I have heard the whispering of the crowd; fear is | all a- | round; *
they put their head together against me; they | plot to | take my | life.
14. But as for me, I have trusted in | you, O | LORD. *
I have | said, "You | are my | God.
15. My times are in | your | hand; *
rescue me from the hand of my enemies, and from | those who | perse- · cute | me.
16. Make your face to shine up- | on your | servant, *
and in your | loving- | kindness | save me.
17. LORD, let me not be ashamed for having | called up- | on you; *
rather, let the wicked be put to shame; let them be | silent | in the | grave.
18. Let the lying lips be silenced with speak a- | gainst the | righteous, *
haughtily, dis- | dainful- · ly, and | with con- | tempt.
19. How great is your goodness, O LORD! which you have laid up for | those who | fear you; *
which you have done in the sight of all for those who | put their | trust in | you.
20. You hide them in the covert of your presence from those who | slander | them; *
you keep them in your shelter | from the | strife of | tongues.
21. Blessed | be the | LORD! *
for he has shown me the wonders of his | love in · a be- | sieged city.
22. Yet I said in my alarm, "I have never been cut off from the | sight · of your | eyes." *
Nevertheless, you heard the sound of my entreaty when I | cried | out to | you.
23. Love the LORD, all you who | worship | him; *
the LORD protects the faithful, but repays to the full | those who | act | haughtily.
24. Be strong and let your | heart take | courage, *
all you who | wait | for the | LORD.
1. Happy are they whose transgressions | are for- | given, *
and whose | sin is | put a- | way!
2. Happy are they to whom the LORD im- | putes no | guilt, *
and in whose | spirit | there is · no | guile.
3. While I held my tongue, my bones | withered · a- | way, *
because of my | groaning | all day | long.
4. For your hand was heavy up- | on me · day and | night; *
my moisture was dried up as | in the | heat of | summer.
5. Then I acknowledged my | sin to | you, *
and did | not con- | ceal my | guilt.
6. I said, "I will confess my transgressions | to the | LORD." *
Then you forgave | me the | guilt · of my | sin.
7. Therefore all the faithful will make their prayers to you in | time of | trouble; *
when the great waters overflow, | they shall | not reach | them.
8. You are my hiding-place; you preserve | me from | trouble; *
you surround me with | shouts | of de- | liverance.
9. "I will instruct you and teach you in the way that | you should | go; *
I will | guide you | with my | eye.
10. Do not be like the horse or mule, which have | no under- | standing; *
who must be fitted with bit and bridle, or else | they will | not stay | near you."
11. Great are the tribulations | of the | wicked; *
but mercy embraces | those who | trust · in the | LORD.
12. Be glad, you righteous, and re- | joice · in the | LORD; *
shout for joy, all | who are | true of | heart.
1. Rejoice in the | LORD, you | righteous; *
it is good | for the | just · to sing | praises.
2. Praise the | LORD · with the | harp; *
play to him up- | on the | psalte- · ry and | lyre.
3. Sing for | him a · new | song; *
sound a fanfare with all your | skill up- | on the | trumpet.
4. For the word of the | LORD is | right, *
and | all his | works are | sure.
5. He loves | righteous- · ness and | justice; *
the loving-kindness of the LORD fills the whole earth.
6. By the word of the LORD | were the · heavens | made, *
by the breath of his mouth | all the | heav'nly | hosts.
7. He gathers up the waters of the ocean | as · in a | water-skin *
and stores up the | depths | of the | sea.
8. Let all the earth | fear the | LORD; *
let all who dwell in the world | stand in | awe of | him.
9. For he spoke, and it | came to | pass; *
he commanded | and it | stood | fast.
10. The LORD brings the will of the | nations · to | naught; *
he | thwarts · the de- | signs · of the | peoples.
11. But the LORD's will stands | fast for | ever, *
and the designs of his | heart from | age to | age.
12. Happy is the nation whose | God · is the LORD! *
happy the people he has | chosen · to | be his | own!
13. The LORD looks | down from | heaven, *
and beholds all the | people in the | world.
14. From where he sits enthroned he | turns his | gaze *
on all who | dwell · on the | earth.
15. He fashions all the | hearts of | them *
and under- | stands | all their | works.
16. There is no king that can be saved by a | mighty | army; *
a strong man is not delivered | by his | great | strength.
17. The horse is a vain | hope · for de- | liverance; *
for all its | strength it | cannot | save.
18. Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon | those who | fear him, *
on those who | wait up- | on his | love.
19. To pluck their | lives from | death, *
and to feed | them in | time of | famine.
20. Our soul | waits · for the | LORD; *
he is our | help | and our | shield.
21. Indeed, our heart re- | joices · in | him, *
for in his holy | Name we | put our | trust.
22. Let your loving-kindness, O LORD, | be up- | on us, *
as we have | put our | trust in | you.
1. I will bless the LORD at | all | times; *
his praise shall | ever · be | in my | mouth.
2. I will | glory · in the | LORD; *
let the | humble | hear · and re- | joice.
3. Proclaim with me the | greatness · of the | LORD; *
let us ex- | alt his | Name to- | gether.
4. I sought the LORD, and he | answered | me *
and delivered me | out of | all my | terror.
5. Look upon him | and be | radiant, *
and let not your | face | be a- | shamed.
6. I called in my affliction | and the · LORD | heard me *
and | saved me · from | all my | troubles.
7. The angel of the LORD encompasses | those who | fear him, *
and | he | will de- | liver them.
8. Taste and see that the | LORD is | good; *
happy are | they who | trust in | him.
9. Fear the LORD, you that | are his | saints, *
for those who | fear him | lack | nothing.
10. The young lions lack and | suffer | hunger, *
but those who seek the LORD lack | nothing | that is | good.
11. Come, children, and | listen · to | me; *
I will teach you the | fear | of the | LORD.
12. Who among you | love | life *
and desires long life | to en- | joy pros- | perity?
13. Keep your tongue from | evil- | speaking *
and you | lips from | lying | words.
14. Turn from evil | and do | good; *
seek | peace | and pur- | sue it.
15. The eyes of the LORD are up- | on the | righteous, *
and his ears are | open | to their | cry.
16. The face of the LORD is against those | who do | evil, *
to root out the remembrance of | them | from the | earth.
17. The righteous cry, and the | LORD | hears them *
and delivers | them from | all their | troubles.
18. The LORD is near to the | broken- | hearted *
and will save | those whose | spirits · are | crushed.
19. Many are the troubles | of the | righteous, *
but the LORD will de- | liver · him | out · of them | all.
20. He will keep safe | all his | bones; *
not | one of · them | shall be | broken.
21. Evil shall | slay the | wicked, *
and those who hate the | righteous | will be | punished.
22. The LORD ransoms the | life · of his | servants, *
and none will be | punished · who | trust | in him.
1. Fight those who | fight me, · O | LORD; *
at- | tack those | who are · at- | tacking me.
2. Take up | shield and | armor *
and | rise up | to help | me.
3. Draw the sword and bar the way against | those who · pur- | sue me; *
say to my | soul, | "I am · your sal- | vation."
4. Let those who seek after my life be a- | shamed and | humbled; *
let those who plot my ruin fall | back and | be a- | shamed.
5. Let them be like chaff be- | fore the | wind, *
and let the angel of the | LORD | drive them · a- | way.
6. Let their way be | dark and | slippery, *
and let the | angel · of the | LORD pur- | sue them.
7. For they have secretly spread a net for me with- | out a | cause; *
without a cause they have dug a | pit to | take · me a- | live.
8. Let ruin come upon them | una- | wares; *
let them be caught in the net they hid; let them fall | into · the | pit they | dug.
9. Then I will be joyful | in the | LORD; *
I will | glory | in his | victory.
10. My very bones will say, "LORD, | who is | like you? *
You deliver the poor from those who are too strong for them, the poor and | needy · from | those who | rob them."
11. Malicious witnesses | rise up · a- | gainst me; *
they charge me with | matters · I know | nothing · a- | bout.
12. They pay me evil in ex- | change for | good; *
my | soul is | full of · de- | spair.
13. But when they were sick I | dressed in | sack-cloth *
and | humbled · my- | self by | fasting.
14. I prayed with my whole heart, as one would for a | friend · or a | brother; *
I behaved like one who mourns for his mother, | bowed | down and | grieving.
15. But when I stumbled, they were glad and gathered together; they | gathered · a- | gainst me; *
strangers whom I did not know tore me to | pieces · and | would not | stop.
16. They put me to the | test and | mocked me; *
and | gnashed at · me | with their | teeth.
17. O Lord, how long | will you · look | on? *
rescue me from the roaring beasts, and my | life · from the | young | lions.
18. I will give you thanks in the | great · congre- | gation; *
I will praise you | in the | mighty | throng.
19. Do not let my treacherous foes re- | joice · over | me, *
nor let those who hate me without a | cause wink | at each | other.
20. For they do not | plan for | peace, *
but invent deceitful schemes against the | quiet | in the | land.
21. They opened their mouths at | me and | said, *
"Aha! we saw it | with our | own | eyes."
22. You saw it, O LORD, do | not be | silent; *
O LORD, | be not | far from | me.
23. Awake, a- | rise · to my | cause! *
to my defense, my | God | and my | Lord!
24. Give me justice, O LORD my God, ac- | cording · to your | righteousness; *
do not let them | triumph | over | me.
25. Do not let them say in their hearts, "Aha! | just · what we | want!" *
Do not let them say, | "We have | swallowed · him | up."
26. Let all who rejoice at my ruin be a- | shamed and · dis- | graced; *
let those who boast against me be clothed | with dis- | may and | shame.
27. Let those who favor my cause sing out with | joy · and be | glad; *
let them say always, "Great is the LORD, who desires the pro- | speri- | ty · of his | servant."
28. And my tongue shall be | talking · of your | righteousness *
and of your | praise | all the · day | long.
1. There is a voice of rebellion deep in the | heart · of the | wicked; *
there is no fear of | God be- | fore his | eyes.
2. He flatters himself in | his own | eyes *
that his hateful sin | will not | be found | out.
3. The words of his mouth are | wicked · and de- | ceitful; *
he has left off acting | wisely · and | doing | good.
4. He thinks up wickedness upon his bed and has set himself in | no good | way; *
he does not ab- | hor | that · which is | evil.
5. Your love, O LORD, | reaches · to the | heavens, *
and your | faithful- · ness | to the | clouds.
6. Your righteousness is like strong mountains, your justice | like the · great | deep; *
you save both | man and | beast, O | LORD.
7. How priceless is your | love, O | God! *
your people take refuge under the | shadow | of your | wings.
8. They feast upon the | abund- · ance | of your | house; *
you give them drink from the | river · of | your de- | lights.
9. For with you is the | well of | life, *
and in | your light | we see | light.
10. Continue your loving-kindness to | those who | know you, *
and your favor to | those · who are | true of | heart.
11. Let not the foot of the | proud come | near me, *
nor the hand of the | wicked | push · me a- | side.
12. See how they are fallen, | those · who work | wickedness! *
they are cast down and | shall not | be ab · le to | rise.
1. Do not fret yourself because of | evil- | doers; *
do not be | jealous · of | those · who do | wrong.
2. For they shall soon wither | like the | grass, *
and like the | green grass | fade a- | way.
3. Put your trust in the LORD | and do | good; *
dwell in the land and | feed | on its | riches.
4. Take delight | in the | LORD, *
and he shall | give · you your | heart's de- | sire.
5. Commit your way to the LORD and | put your · trust | in him, *
and | he will | bring · it to | pass.
6. He will make your righteousness as | clear as | light *
and your just | dealing | as the | noonday.
7. Be still be- | fore the | LORD *
and | wait | patient- · ly | for him.
8. Do not fret yourself over | one who | prospers, *
the one who suc- | ceeds in | evil | schemes.
9. Refrain from anger, leave | rage a- | lone; *
do not fret yourself; it leads | on- | ly to | evil.
10. For evildoers shall | be cut | off, *
but those who wait upon the LORD | shall pos- | sess the | land.
11. In a little while the wicked | shall be · no | more; *
you shall search out their place, but | they will | not be | there.
12. But the lowly shall pos- | sess the | land; *
they will delight | in a- | bundance · of | peace.
13. The wicked plot a- | gainst the | righteous *
and | gnash · at them | with their | teeth.
14. The LORD laughs | at the | wicked, *
because he | sees their | day will | come.
15. The wicked draw their sword and bend their bow to strike down the | poor and | needy, *
to slaughter those who are | upright | in their | ways.
16. Their sword shall go through | their own | heart, *
and their | bow | shall be | broken.
17. The little that the | righteous | has *
is better than great | riches | of the | wicked.
18. For the power of the wicked | shall be | broken, *
but the | LORD up- | holds the | righteous.
19. The LORD cares for the | lives · of the | godly, *
and their in- | heri- · tance shall | last for | ever.
20. They shall not be ashamed in | bad | times, *
and in days of famine | they shall | have e- | nough.
21. As for the wicked, | they shall | perish, *
and the enemies of the LORD, like the glory of the | mead- | ows, shall | vanish.
22. The wicked borrow and do | not re- | pay, *
but the righteous are | gener- | ous in | giving.
23. Those who are blessed by God shall pos- | sess the | land, *
but those who are cursed by | him shall | be des- | troyed.
24. Our steps are directed | by the | LORD; *
he strengthens those | in whose | way · he de- | lights.
25. If they stumble, they shall | not fall | headlong, *
for the LORD | holds them | by the | hand.
26. I have been young and now | I am | old, *
but never have I seen the righteous forsaken, or their | children | begging | bread.
27. The righteous are always gener- | ous in | lending, *
and their | children · shall | be a | blessing.
28. Turn from evil | and do | good, *
and dwell | in the | land for | ever.
29. For the | LORD loves | justice; *
he does not for- | sake his | faithful | ones.
30. They shall be kept | safe for | ever, *
but the offspring of the | wicked · shall | be des- | troyed.
31. The righteous shall pos- | sess the | land *
and | dwell in | it for | ever.
32. The mouth of the righteous | utters | wisdom, *
and their | tongue speaks | what is | right.
33. The law of their God is | in their | heart, *
and their | footsteps | shall not | falter.
34. The wicked | spy · on the | righteous *
and | seek oc- | casion to | kill them.
35. The LORD will not abandon them | to their | hand, *
nor let them be found | guilty · when | brought to | trial.
36. Wait upon the LORD and | keep his | way; *
he will raise you up to possess the land, and when the wicked are | cast off, | you will | see it.
37. I have seen the wicked | in their | arrogance, *
flourishing like a | tree | in full | leaf.
38. I went by, and behold, they | were not | there; *
I searched for them, but | they could | not be | found.
39. Mark those who are honest; ob- | serve the up- | right; *
for there is a | future | for the | peaceable.
40. Transgressors shall be destroyed, | one and | all; *
the future of the | wicked | is cut | off.
41. But the deliverance of the righteous | comes · from the | LORD; *
he is their | stronghold · in | time of | trouble.
42. The LORD will help them and | rescue | them; *
he will rescue them from the wicked and deliver them, because | they seek | refuge · in | him.
1. O LORD, do not rebuke me | in your | anger; *
do not | punish · me | in your | wrath.
2. For your arrows have al- | ready | pierced me, *
and your hand | presses | hard up- | on me.
3. There is no health in my flesh, because of | your in- | dignation; *
there is no soundness in my body, be- | cause | of my | sin.
4. For my iniquities | over- | whelm me; *
like a heavy burden they are too | much for | me to | bear.
5. My wounds | stink and | fester *
by | reason | of my | foolishness.
6. I am utterly bowed | down and | prostrate; *
I go about in | mourning | all the · day | long.
7. My loins are filled with | searing | pain; *
there is no | health | in my | body.
8. I am utterly | numb and | crushed; *
I wail because of the | groaning | of my | heart.
9. O LORD, you know | all · my de- | sires, *
and my sighing | is not | hidden | from you.
10. My heart is pounding, my | strength has | failed me; *
and the brightness of my | eyes is | gone from | me.
11. My friends and companions draw back from | my af- | fliction; *
my | neighbors | stand far | off.
12. Those who seek after my life lay | snares for | me; *
those who strive to hurt me speak of my ruin and plot | treache- · ry | all the · day | long.
13. But I am like the deaf who | do not | hear, *
like those who are mute and | do not | open · their | mouth.
14. I have become like one who | does not | hear *
and from whose | mouth comes | no de- | fense.
15. For in you, O LORD, have I | fixed my | hope; *
you will answer | me, O | Lord my | God.
16. For I said, "Do not let them rejoice at | my ex- | pense, *
those who gloat | over · me | when my | foot slips."
17. Truly, I am on the | verge of | falling, *
and my | pain is | always | with me.
18. I will confess | my in- | iquity *
and be | sorry | for my | sin.
19. Those who are my enemies without | cause are | mighty, *
and many in number are | those who | wrongful- · ly | hate me.
20. Those who repay evil for good | slander | me, *
because I follow the | course | that is | right.
21. O LORD, do | not for- | sake me; *
be not | far from | me, O | God.
22. Make | haste to | help me, *
O | Lord of | my sal- | vation.
1. I said, "I will keep watch up- | on my | ways, *
so that I do | not of- | fend · with my | tongue.
2. I will put a muzzle | on my | mouth *
while the | wicked · are | in my | presence."
3. So I held my tongue | and said | nothing; *
I refrained from rash words; but my | pain be- | came un- | bearable.
4. My heart was hot within me; while I pondered, the fire burst | into | flame; *
I | spoke out | with my | tongue:
5. LORD, let me know my end and the | number · of my | days, *
so that I may | know how | short my | life is.
6. You have given me a mere handful of days, and my lifetime is nothing | in your | sight; *
truly, even those who stand erect are | but a | puff of | wind.
7. We walk about like a shadow, and in vain we | are in | turmoil; *
we heap up riches and cannot tell | who will | gather | them.
8. And now, | what · is my | hope? *
O | Lord, my | hope · is in | you.
9. Deliver me from | all · my trans- | gressions *
and do not | make · me the | taunt · of a | fool.
10. I fell silent and did not | open · my | mouth, *
for surely | it was | you that | did it.
11. Take your af- | fliction | from me; *
I am worn down | by the | blows · of your | hand.
12. With rebukes for sin you punish us; like a moth you eat away | all · that is | dear to us; *
truly, everyone is | but a | puff of | wind.
13. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give | ear · to my | cry; *
hold | not your | peace · at my | tears.
14. For I am a | sojourn- · er | with you, *
a wayfarer, as | all my | forebears | were.
15. Turn your gaze from me, that I may be | glad a- | gain, *
before I go my | way and | am no | more.
1. LORD, how many | adversaries · I | have! *
how many there are who rise | up a- | gainst me!
2. How many there are who | say of | me, *
"There is no | help for | him · in his | God."
3. But you, O LORD, are a | shield a- | bout me, *
you are my glory, the | one who · lifts | up my | head.
4. I call aloud up- | on the | LORD, *
and he answers me | from his | holy | hill.
5. I lie down and | go to | sleep; *
I wake again, be- | cause the | LORD sus- | tains me.
6. I do not fear the | multi- · tudes of | people *
who set themselves a- | gainst me | all a- | round.
7. Rise up, O LORD; set me free, | O my | God; *
surely, you will strike all my enemies across the face, you will | break the | teeth · of the | wicked.
8. Deliverance be- | longs · to the | LORD. *
Your blessing | be up- | on your | people.
1 I waited patiently up- | on the | LORD; *
he stooped to | me and | heard my | cry.
2 He lifted me out of the desolate pit, out of the | mire and | clay; *
he set my feet upon a high cliff and | made my | footing | sure.
3 He put a new song in my mouth, a song of | praise · to our | God; *
many shall see, and stand in awe, and | put their | trust · in the | LORD.
4 Happy are they who trust | in the | LORD! *
they do not resort to evil spirits or | turn to | false | gods.
5 Great things are they that you have done, O LORD my God!how great your wonders and your | plans for | us! *
there is none who can | be com- | pared with | you.
6 Oh, that I could make them known | and tell | them! *
but they are | more than | I can | count.
7 In sacrifice and offering you | take no | pleasure *
(you have | giv'n me | ears to | hear you);
8 Burnt-offering and sin-offering you have | not re- | quired, *
and so I | said, "Be- | hold, I | come.
9 In the roll of the book it is written con- | cerning | me: *
'I love to do your will, O my God; your | law is | deep · in my | heart.'"
10 I proclaimed righteousness in the great | congre- | gation; *
behold, I did not restrain my lips; and | that, O | LORD, you | know.
11 Your righteousness have I not hidden in my heart; I have spoken of your faithfulness and | your de- | liverance; *
I have not concealed your love and faithfulness from the | great | congre- | gation.
12 You are the LORD; do not withhold your com- | passion | from me; *
let your love and your faithfulness | keep me | safe for | ever,
13 For innumerable troubles have crowded upon me; my sins have overtaken me, and I | cannot | see; *
they are more in number than the hairs of my head, | and my | heart | fails me.
14 Be pleased, O LORD, to de- | liver | me; *
O | LORD, make | haste to | help me.
15 Let them be ashamed and altogether dismayed who seek after my | life · to des- | troy it; *
let them draw back and be disgraced who take | pleasure · in | my · mis- | fortune.
16 Let those who say "Aha!" and gloat over me | be con- | founded, *
be- | cause they | are a- | shamed.
17 Let all who seek you rejoice in you | and be | glad; *
let those who love your salvation continually say, | "Great | is the | LORD!"
18 Though I am | poor · and af- | flicted, *
the Lord will | have re- | gard for | me.
19 You are my helper and | my de- | liverer; *
do not | tarry, | O my | God.
1. Happy are they who consider the | poor and | needy! *
the LORD will deliver them | in the | time of | trouble.
2. The LORD preserves them and keeps them alive, so that they may be | happy · in the | land; *
he does not hand them | over · to the | will · of their | enemies.
3. The LORD sustains them | on their | sickbed *
and | ministers · to them | in their | illness.
4. I said, "LORD, be | merci- · ful to | me; *
heal me, for | I have | sinned a- | gainst you."
5. My enemies are saying | wicked · things a- | bout me: *
"When will he | die, · and his | name | perish?"
6. Even if they come to see me, they speak | empty | words; *
their heart collects false rumors; they | go out- | side and | spread them.
7. All my enemies whisper to- | gether · a- | bout me *
and devise | evil | against me.
8. "A deadly thing," they say, "has | fastened · on | him; *
he has taken to his bed and will | never · get | up a- | gain."
9. Even my best friend, whom I trusted, | who broke | bread with me, *
has lifted up his | heel and | turned a- | gainst me.
10. But you, O LORD, be merciful to me and | raise me | up, *
and | I | shall re- | pay them
11. By this I know you are | pleased | with me, *
that my enemy does not | triumph | over | me.
12. In my integrity you | hold me | fast, *
and shall set me be- | fore your | face for | ever.
13. Blessed be the LORD | God of | Israel, *
from age to | age. A- | men. A- | men.
1. Give judgment for me, O God, and defend my cause against an un- | godly | people; *
deliver me from the de- | ceitful | and the | wicked.
2. For you are the God of my strength; why have you | put me | from you? *
and why do I go so heavily while the | enemy · op- | presses | me?
3. Send out your light and your truth, that | they may | lead me, *
and bring me to your holy | hill and | to your | dwelling.
4. That I may go to the altar of God, to the God of my | joy and | gladness; *
and on the harp I will give thanks to | you, O | God my | God.
5. Why are you so full of heaviness, | O my | soul? *
and why are you so dis- | quiet- | ed with- | in me?
6. Put your | trust in | God; *
for I will yet give thanks to him, who is the help of my | counte- · nance | and my | God.
1. We have heard with out ears, O God, our | forefathers · have | told us, *
the deeds that you did in their days, | in the | days of | old.
2. How with your hand you drove the peoples out and planted our forefathers | in the | land; *
how you destroyed nations and | made your | peoples | flourish.
3. For they did not take the land by their sword, nor did their right arm win the | victory · for | them; *
but your right hand, your arm, and the light of your countenance, be- | cause you | favored | them.
4. You are my | King · and my | God; *
you command | victor- | ies for | Jacob.
5. Through you we pushed | back our | adversaries; *
through your Name trampled on | those who | rose · up a- | gainst us.
6. For I do not | rely on · my | bow, *
and my sword | does not | give me | the victory.
7. Surely, you gave us victory | over · our | adversaries *
and put | those · who | hate us · to | shame.
8. Every day we | gloried · in | God, *
and we will | praise your | Name for | ever.
9. Nevertheless, you have re- | jected · and | humbled us *
and do not go | forth | with our | enemies.
10. You have made us fall back be- | fore our | adversary, *
and our | ene- · mies have | plundered | us.
11. You have made us like | sheep · to be | eaten *
and have | scattered · us a- | mong the | nations.
12. You are selling your | people · for a | trifle *
and are making no profit | on the | sale of | them
13. You have made us the | scorn · of our | neighbors, *
a | mockery · of | those a- | round us.
14. You have made us a byword a- | mong the | nations, *
a laughing | stock a- | mong the | peoples.
15. My humiliation is | daily · be- | fore me, *
and | shame has | covered · my | face;
16. Because of the taunts of the | mockers and | blasphemers, *
because of the | ene- · my | and a- | venger.
17. All this has come | upon | us; *
yet we have not forgotten you, nor have | we be- | trayed your | covenant.
18. Our heart | never · turned | back, *
nor did our | footsteps | stray · from your | path.
19. Though you thrust us down into a | place of | misery, *
and covered us | over · with | deep | darkness.
20. If we have forgotten the | Name · of our | God, *
or stretched out our | hands to | some strange | god.
21. Will not God | find it | out? *
for he knows the | secrets | of the | heart.
22. Indeed, for your sake we killed | all the · day | long; *
we are accounted as | sheep | for the | slaughter.
23. Awake, O Lord! | why are · you | sleeping? *
Arise! | do not | re- · ject us for | ever.
24. Why have you | hidden · your | face *
and forgotten our af- | flictions | and op- | pression.
25. We sink down | into · the | dust; *
our | body · cleaves · to the | ground.
26. Rise | up and | help us, *
and save us, for the | sake · of your | steadfast | love.
1. My heart is stirring with a noble song; let me recite what I have fashioned | for the | king; *
my tongue shall be the | pen | of a · skilled | writer.
2. You are the | fairest · of | men; *
grace flows from your lips, because | God has | blessed you · for | ever.
3. Strap your sword upon your thigh, O | mighty | warrior, *
in your | pride | and · in your | majesty.
4. Ride out and conquer in the | cause of | truth *
and | for the | sake of | justice.
5. Your right hand will show you | marvel- · ous | things; *
your arrows are very sharp, O | mighty | warrior.
6. The peoples are falling | at your | feet, *
and the king's ene- | mies are | losing | heart.
7. Your throne, O God, endures for | ever · and | ever, *
a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom; you love righteousness and | hate in- | iqui- | ty.
8. Therefore God, your God, has a- | nointed | you *
with the oil of | gladness · a- | bove your | fellows.
9. All your garments are fragrant with myrrh, | aloes · and | cassia, *
and the music of strings from ivory | pala- · ces | makes you | glad.
10. Kings' daughters stand among the | ladies · of the | court; *
on your right hand is the queen, ad- | orned with | gold of | Ophir.
11. "Hear, O daughter; consider and | listen | closely; *
forget your people | and your | father's | house.
12. The king will have pleasure | in your | beauty; *
he is your master; | therefore | do him | honor.
13. The people of Tyre are here | with a | gift; *
the rich among the | people | seek your | favor."
14. All glorious is the princess | as she | enters; *
her | gown is | cloth-of- | gold.
15. In embroidered apparel she is | brought · to the | king; *
after her the bridesmaids | follow | in pro- | cession.
16. With joy and gladness | they are | brought, *
and enter into the | palace | of the | king.
17. "In place of fathers, O king, you | shall have | sons; *
you shall make them princes | over | all the | earth.
18. I will make your name to be remembered from one generation | to an- | other; *
therefore nations will praise you for | ev- | er and | ever.
1 God is our | refuge · and | strength, *
a very | pre-sent | help in | trouble.
2.Therefore we will not fear, though the | earth be | moved, *
and though the mountains be toppled | into · the | depths · of the | sea;
3.Though its waters | rage and | foam, *
and though the mountains | trem-ble | at its | tumult.
4 The LORD of | hosts is | with us; *
the God of | Ja-cob | is our | stronghold.
5 There is a river whose streams make glad the | city · of | God, *
the holy habitation | of the | Most | High.
6 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be | o-ver- | thrown; *
God shall help her | at the | break of | day.
7 The nations make much ado, and the | kingdoms · are | shaken; *
God has spoken, and the | earth shall | melt a- | way.
8 The LORD of | hosts is | with us; *
the God of | Jacob | is our | stronghold.
9 Come now and look upon the | works · of the | LORD, *
what awesome things | he has | done on | earth.
10 It is he who makes war to cease in | all the | world; *
he breaks the bow, and shatters the spear, and | burns the | shields with | fire.
11 "Be still, then, and know that | I am | God; *
I will be exalted among the nations; I will be ex- | al-ted | in the | earth."
12 The LORD of | hosts is | with us; *
the God of | Ja-cob | is our | stronghold.
1. Clap your hands, | all you | peoples; *
shout to | God · with a | cry of | joy.
2. For the LORD Most High | is · to be | feared; *
he is the great | King · over | all the | earth.
3. He subdues the | peoples | under us, *
and the | nations | under · our | feet.
4. He chooses our in- | heri- · tance | for us, *
the pride of | Jacob | whom he | loves.
5. God has gone | up · with a | shout, *
the | LORD · with the | sound · of the | ram's-horn.
6. Sing praises to | God, sing | praises; *
sing | praises · to our | King, sing | praises.
7. For God is the King of the | whole | earth; *
sing | praises · with | all your | skill.
8. God reigns | over · the | nations; *
God sits up- | on his | holy | throne.
9. The nobles of the peoples have | gathered · to- | gether *
with the | people · of the | God of | Abraham.
10. The rulers of the earth be- | long to | God, *
and | he is | highly · ex- | alted.
1. Great is the LORD, and | highly · to be | praised; *
in the city of our God | is his | holy | hill.
2. Beautiful and lofty, the joy of all the earth, is the | hill of | Zion, *
the very center of the world and the | city · of the | great | King.
3. God is | in her | citadels; *
he is | known · to be her | sure | refuge.
4. Behold, the kings of the | earth as- | sembled *
and | march'd | forward · to- | gether.
5. They looked and | were a- | stounded; *
they re- | treated · and | fled in | terror.
6. Trembling | seized them | there; *
they writhed like a woman in childbirth, like ships of the sea | when the | east wind | shatters them.
7. As we have heard, so have we seen, in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the | city · of our | God; *
God has est- | ablished | her for | ever.
8. We waited in silence on your loving- | kindness, · O | God, *
in the | midst | of your | temple.
9. Your praise, like your Name, O God, reaches to the | world's | end; *
your right | hand is | full of | justice.
10. Let Mount Zion be glad and the cities of | Judah · re- | joice, *
be- | cause | of your | judgments.
11. Make the circuit of Zion; walk | round a- | bout her; *
count the | number | of her | towers.
12. Consider well her bulwarks; ex- | amine · her | strongholds; *
that you may | tell those | who come | after.
13. This God is our God for | ever · and | ever; *
he shall be our | guide for | ever- | more.
1. Hear this, all you peoples; hearken, all you who | dwell · in the | world, *
you of high degree and low, | rich and | poor to- | gether.
2. My mouth shall | speak of | wisdom, *
and my heart shall | medi- · tate on | under- | standing.
3. I will incline my | ear · to a | proverb *
and set forth my | riddle · up- | on the | harp.
4. Why should I be afraid in | evil | days, *
when the wickedness of those | at my | heels sur- | rounds me,
5. The wickedness of those who put their | trust · in their | goods, *
and | boast of | their great | riches?
6. We can never | ransom · our- | selves, *
or deliver to | God the | price · of our | life.
7. For the ransom of our life | is so | great, *
that we should never | have e- | nough to | pay for it.
8. In order to live for | ever · and | ever, *
and | never | see the | grave.
9. For we see that the wise die also; like the dull and | stupid · they | perish *
and leave their wealth to | those · who come | after | them.
10. Their graves shall be their homes for ever, their dwelling places from gener- | ation · to gen- | eration, *
though they call the lands | after | their own | names.
11. Even though honored, they cannot | live for | ever; *
they are | like the | beasts that | perish.
12. Such is the way of those who foolishly | trust · in them- | selves, *
and the end of those who de- | light in | their own | words.
13. Like a flock of sheep they are destined to die; | Death · is their | shepherd; *
they go down | straightway | to the | grave.
14. Their form shall | waste a- | way, *
and the land of the | dead shall | be their | home.
15. But God will | ransom · my | life; *
he will snatch me | from the | grasp of | death.
16. Do not be envious when | some be- · come | rich, *
or when the | grandeur · of their | house in- | creases;
17. For they carry nothing a- | way · at their | death, *
nor | will their | grandeur | follow them.
18. Though they thought highly of themselves | while they | lived, *
and were | praised for | their suc- | cess.
19. They shall join the | company · of their | forebears, *
who will never | see the | light a- | gain.
20. Those who are honored, but have no | unders- | tanding, *
are | like the | beasts that | perish.
1. Answer me when I call, O God, | defender · of my | cause; *
you set me free when I am hard-pressed; have mercy on | me and | hear my | prayer.
2. "You mortals, how long will you dis- | honor · my | glory; *
how long will you worship dumb idols and run | after | other | gods?"
3. Know that the LORD does | wonders · for the | faithful; *
when I call upon the | LORD | he will | hear me.
4. Tremble, then, and | do not | sin; *
speak to your heart in | silence · up- | on your | bed.
5. Offer the ap- | pointed | sacrifices *
and | put your | trust · in the | LORD.
6. Many are saying, "Oh that we might | see · better | times!" *
Lift up the light of your | counte- · nance | upon · us, O | LORD.
7. You have put | gladness · in my | heart, *
more than when grain and | wine and | oil | increase.
8. I lie down in peace; at once I | fall a- | sleep; *
for only you, LORD, | make me | dwell in | safety.
1. The LORD, the | God of · gods, has | spoken; *
he has called the earth from the rising of the | sun | to its | setting.
2. Out of Zion, perfect | in its | beauty, *
God re- | veals him- | self in | glory.
3. Our God will come and will | not keep | silence; *
before him there is a consuming flame, and round | about · him a | raging | storm.
4. He calls the heavens and the earth | from a- | bove *
to witness the | judgment | of his | people.
5. "Gather before me my | loyal | followers, *
those who have made a covenant with me and | seal'd | it with | sacrifice.
6. Let the heavens declare the | rightness · of his | cause; *
for | God him- | self is | judge.
7. Hear, O my people, and I will speak: "O Israel, I will bear | witness · a- | gainst you: *
for | I am | God, your | God.
8. I do not accuse you be- | cause of · your | sacrifices; *
your offerings | are al- | ways be- | fore me.
9. I will take no bull-calf | from your | stalls, *
nor | he-goats | out of · your | pens;
10. For all the of the | forest · are | mine, *
the herds in their | thousands · up- | on the | hills.
11. I know every | bird · in the | sky, *
and the creatures of the | fields are | in my | sight.
12. If I were hungry, I | would not | tell you, *
for the whole world is | mine and | all · that is | in it.
13. Do you think I eat the | flesh of | bulls, *
or | drink the | blood of | goats?
14. Offer to God a | sacri- · fice of | thanksgiving *
and make good your | vows | to the · Most | High.
15. Call upon me in the | day of | trouble; *
I will deliver you, and | you shall | honor | me."
16. But to the wicked | God | says: *
"Why do you recite my statutes, and take my | cove- · nant up- | on your | lips;
17. Since you re- | fuse | discipline, *
and toss my | words be- | hind your | back?
18. When you see a thief, you | make him · your | friend, *
and you | cast in | your lot · with a- | dulterers.
19. You have loosed your | lips for | evil, *
and harnessed your | tongue | to a | lie.
20. You are always speaking | evil · of your | brother *
and slandering your | own | mother's | son.
21. These things you have done, and | I kept | still, *
and you | thought that | I am | like you."
22. "I have made my | accu- | sation; *
I have put my case | in · order be- | fore your | eyes.
23. Consider this well, you | who for- · get | God, *
lest I rend you and there | be none | to de- | liver you.
24. Whoever offers me the sacrifice of thanksgiving | honors | me; *
but to those who keep my way will I | show the · sal- | vation · of | God."
1 Have mercy on me, O God, according to your | loving- | kindness; *
in your great compassion | blot out | my o- | ffenses.
2 Wash me through and through | from my | wickedness *
and | cleanse me | from my | sin.
3 For I | know my · trans- | gressions, *
and my | sin is | ever · be- | fore me.
4 Against you only | have I | sinned *
and done what is | evil | in your | sight.
5 And so you are justified | when you | speak *
and | upright | in your | judgment.
6 Indeed, I have been wicked | from my | birth, *
a sinner | from my | mother's | womb.
7 For behold, you look for truth | deep with- | in me, *
and will make me understand | wisdom | secret- | ly.
8 Purge me from my sin, and | I · shall be | pure; *
wash me, and I | shall be | clean in- | deed.
9 Make me hear of | joy and | gladness, *
that the body you have | broken | may re- | joice.
10 Hide your | face · from my | sins *
and blot out | all my | ini- · qui- | ties.
11 Create in me a clean | heart, O | God, *
and renew a right | spirit · with- | in | me.
12 Cast me not away | from your | presence *
and take not your | holy | Spirit | from me.
13 Give me the joy of your saving | help a- | gain *
and sustain me | with your | bounti- · ful | Spirit.
14 I shall teach your | ways · to the | wicked, *
and sinners | shall re- | turn to | you.
15 Deliver me from | death, O | God, *
and my tongue shall sing of your righteousness, O | God of | my sal- | vation.
16 Open my | lips, O | Lord, *
and my | mouth · shall pro- | claim your | praise.
17 Had you desired it, I would have | offered | sacrifice, *
but you take no de- | light in | burnt- | offerings.
18 The sacrifice of God is a | troubled | spirit; *
a broken and contrite heart, O God, | you will | not de- | spise.
19 Be favorable and | gracious · to | Zion, *
and rebuild the | walls · of Je- | rusa- | lem.
20 Then you will be pleased with the appointed sacrifices, with burnt-offerings and | obla- | tions; *
then shall they offer young | bullocks · up- | on your | altar.
1. You tyrant, why do you | boast of | wickedness *
against the | godly | all day | long?
2. You plot ruin; your tongue is like a | sharpened | razor, *
O | worker | of de- | ception.
3. You love evil | more than | good *
and lying | more than | speaking · the | truth.
4. You love all | words that | hurt, *
O | you de- | ceitful | tongue.
5. Oh, that God would de- | molish · you | utterly, *
topple you, and snatch you from your dwelling, and root you out of the | land | of the | living!
6. The righteous shall | see and | tremble, *
and they shall | laugh | at him, | saying,
7. "This is the one who did not take | God · for a | refuge, *
but trusted in great wealth and re- | lied | upon | wickedness."
8. But I am like a green olive tree in the | house of | God; *
I trust in the mercy of | God for | ever · and | ever.
9. I will give you thanks for what | you have | done *
and declare the goodness of your Name in the | presence | of the | godly.
1. The fool has said in his heart, "There | is no | God." *
All are corrupt and commit abominable acts; there is | none who | does · any | good.
2. God looks down from | heav'n up- | on us | all, *
to see if there is any who is wise, if there is one | who seeks | after | God.
3. Every one has proved faithless; all alike | have turned | bad; *
there is none who | does good; | no, not | one.
4. Have they no knowledge, those | evil- | doers *
who eat up my people like bread and | do not | call · upon | God.
5. See how greatly they tremble, such trembling as | never | was; *
for God has scattered the bones of the enemy; they are put to shame, be- | cause God | has re- | jected them.
6. Oh, that Israel's deliverance would come | out of | Zion! *
when God restores the fortunes of his people Jacob will re- | joice and | Israel · be | glad.
1. Save me, O God, | by your | Name; *
in your | might, de- | fend my | cause.
2. Hear my | pray'r, O | God; *
give | ear · to the | words · of my | mouth.
3. For the arrogant have risen up against me, and the ruthless have | sought my | life, *
those who have | no re- | gard for | God.
4. Behold, God | is my | helper; *
it is the Lord | who sus- | tains my | life.
5. Render evil to those who | spy on | me; *
in your | faithful- | ness des- | troy them.
6. I will offer you a | freewill | sacrifice *
and praise your Name, O | LORD, for | it is | good.
7. For you have rescued me from | ev'ry | trouble, *
and my eye has seen the | ruin | of my | foes.
1. Hear my | prayer, · O | God; *
do not hide | yourself | from my | petition.
2. Listen to me and | answer | me; *
I have no | peace, be- | cause · of my | cares.
3. I am shaken by the noise | of the | enemy *
and by the | pressure | of the | wicked.
4. For they have cast an evil spell | upon | me *
and are | set a- | gainst me · in | fury.
5. My heart | quakes with- | in me, *
and the terrors of death have | fallen | upon | me.
6. Fear and trembling | have come | over me, *
and | horror | over- | whelms me.
7. And I said, "Oh, that I had wings | like a | dove! *
I would fly a- | way and | be at | rest.
8. I would flee to a | far-off | place *
and make my | lodging · in the | wilderness.
9. I would hasten | to es- | cape *
from the | stormy | wind and | tempest."
10. Swallow them up, O LORD; con- | found their | speech; *
for I have seen violence and | strife | in the | city.
11. Day and night the watchmen make their rounds up- | on her | walls, *
but trouble and misery are | in the | midst of | her.
12. There is corruption | at her | heart; *
her streets are never free of op- | pression | and de- | ceit.
13. For had it been an adversary who taunted me, then I | could have | borne it; *
or had it been an enemy who vaunted himself against me, then I | could have | hidden · from | him.
14. But it was you, a man after | my own | heart, *
my companion, my | own fa- | miliar | friend.
15. We took sweet | counsel · to- | gether, *
and walked with the throng | in the | house of | God.
16. Let death come upon them suddenly; let them go down alive | into · the | grave; *
for wickedness is in their dwellings, | in their | very | midst.
17. But I will | call up- · on | God, *
and the | LORD | will de- | liver me.
18. In the evening, in the morning and at noonday, I will | complain · and | lament, *
and | he will | hear my | voice.
19. He will bring me safely back from the battle | waged a- | gainst me; *
for there are | many | who fight | me.
20. God, who is enthroned of old, will hear me and | bring them | down; *
they never change; | they do | not fear | God.
21. My friend stretched forth his hand a- | gainst the | comrade; *
he | has · broken | his cov- | enant.
22. His speech is | softer · than | butter, *
but | war is | in his | heart.
23. His words are | smoother · than | oil, *
but | they are | drawn | swords.
24. Cast your burden upon the LORD, and | he will · sus- | tain you; *
he will never | let the | righteous | stumble.
25. For you will bring the bloodthirsty | and de- | ceitful *
down to the | pit of · de- | struction, · O | God.
26. They shall not live out | half their | days, *
but I will | put my | trust in | you.
1. Have mercy on me, O God, for my | ene- · mies are | hounding me; *
all day | long · they as- | sault · and op- | press me.
2. They hound me | all the · day | long; *
truly there are many who fight a- | gainst me, | O Most | High.
3. Whenever I | am a- | fraid, *
I will | put my | trust in | you.
4. In God, whose word I praise, in God I trust and will | not · be a- | fraid, *
for what can | flesh · do to | me?
5. All day long they | damage · my | cause; *
their only thought | is to | do me | evil.
6. They band together; they | lie in | wait; *
they spy upon my footsteps; be- | cause they | seek my | life.
7. Shall they escape de- | spite their | wickedness? *
O God, in your | anger, · cast | down the | peoples.
8. You have noted my lamentation; put my tears | into · your | bottle; *
are they not re- | corded | in your | book?
9. Whenever I call upon you, my enemies will be | put to | flight; *
this I know, for | God is | on my | side.
10. In God the LORD, whose word I praise, in God I trust and will not | be a- | fraid, *
for what can | mortals | do to | me?
11. I am bound by the vow I made to | you, O | God; *
I will pre- | sent to | you thank- | offerings;
12. For you have rescued my soul from death and my | feet from | stumbling, *
that I may walk before God in the | light | of the | living.
1. Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful, for I have taken | refuge · in | you; *
in the shadow of your wings will I take refuge until this time of | trouble | has gone | by.
2. I will call upon the | Most High | God, *
the God | who main- | tains my | cause.
3. He will send from heaven and save me; he will confound those who | trample · up- | on me; *
God will send forth his | love | and his | faithfulness.
4. I lie in the midst of lions that de- | vour the | people; *
their teeth are spears and arrows, their | tongue | a sharp | sword.
5. They have laid a net for my feet, and | I am · bowed | low; *
they have dug a pit before me, but have fallen | into | it them- | selves.
1. Do you indeed decree | righteous. · you | rulers? *
do you | judge the | peoples · with | equity?
2. No; you devise evil | in your | hearts, *
and your hands | deal out | violence · in the | land.
3. The wicked are perverse | from the | womb; *
liars go a- | stray | from their | birth.
4. They are as venomous | as a | serpent, *
they are like the deaf | adder · which | stops its | ears,
5. Which does not heed the | voice · of the | charmer, *
no | matter · how | skillful · his | charming.
6. O God, break their teeth | in their | mouths; *
pull the | fangs · of the | young lions, · O | LORD.
7. Let them vanish like water that | runs | off; *
let them | wither · like | trodden | grass.
8. Let them be like the snail that | melts a- | way, *
like a stillborn child that | never | sees the | sun.
9. Before they bear fruit, let them be cut down | like a | brier; *
like thorns and thistles | let them · be | swept a- | way.
10. The righteous will be glad when they | see the | vengeance; *
they will bathe their | feet · in the | blood · of the | wicked.
11. And they will say, "Surely, there is a | reward · for the | righteous; *
surely, there is a | God who | rules · in the | earth."
1. Protect me from my ene- | mies, O | God; *
protect me from those | who rise | up a- | gainst me.
2. Rescue me from | evil- | doers *
and save me from those who | thirst | for my | blood.
3. See how they lie in wait for my life, how the mighty gather to- | gether · a- | gainst me; *
not for any of- | fense or | fault of | mine.
4. Not for any | guilt of | mine *
they run and pre- | pare them- | selves for | battle.
5. Rouse yourself, come to my | side, and | see; *
for you, LORD God of | hosts, | Israel's | God.
6. Awake, and punish | all the un- | godly; *
show no mercy to those | who are | faithless · and | evil.
7. They go to and fro | in the | evening; *
they snarl like dogs and | run a- | bout the | city.
8. Behold, they boast with their mouths, and taunts are | on their | lips; *
"For who, | "they say, " | will hear | us?"
9. But you, O LORD, you | laugh at | them; *
you laugh | all the · un- | godly | to scorn.
10. My eyes are fixed on you, | O my | Strength; *
for you, | O God | are my | stronghold.
11. My merciful God | comes to | meet me; *
God will let me look in | triumph | on my | enemies.
12. Slay them, O God, lest my | people · for- | get it; *
send them reeling by your might and put them | down, O | Lord our | shield.
13. For the sins of their mouths, for the words of their lips, for the | cursing · and | lies · that they | utter, *
let them be | caught | in their | pride.
14. Make an end of them | in your | wrath; *
make an end of them, and | they shall | be no | more.
15. Let everyone know that God | rules in | Jacob, *
and | to the | ends · of the | earth.
16. They go to and fro | in the | evening; *
they snarl like dogs and | run a- | bout the | city.
17. They | forage · for | food, *
and if they | are not | filled they | howl.
18. For my part, I will | sing of · your | strength; *
I will celebrate your | love | in the | morning.
19. For you have be- | come my | stronghold, *
a refuge | in the | day of | trouble.
20. To you, O my Strength, | will I | sing; *
for you, O God, are my stronghold | and my | merci- · ful | God.
1. Give ear to my | word, O | LORD; *
con- | sider · my | medi- | tation.
2. Hearken to my cry for help, my | King · and my | God, *
for I | make my | prayer to | you.
3. In the morning, LORD, you | hear my | voice; *
early in the morning I make my ap- | peal and | watch for | you.
4. For you are not a God who takes | pleasure · in | wickedness, *
and evil | cannot | dwell with | you.
5. Braggarts cannot | stand · in your | sight; *
you hate | all those | who work | wickedness.
6. You destroy | those who · speak | lies; *
the bloodthirsty and | deceitful, · O | LORD, you | abhor.
7. But as for me, through the greatness of your mercy I will go | into · your | house; *
I will bow down toward your holy | temple · in | awe of | you.
8. Lead me, O LORD, in your righteousness, because of those who lie in | wait for | me: *
make | your way | straight be- | fore us.
9. There there is no | truth · in their | mouth; *
there is des- | truction | in their | hearts.
10. Their throat is an | open | grave; *
they | flatter | with their | tongue.
11. Declare them | guilty, · O | God; *
let them | fall, be- | cause of · their | schemes.
12. Because of their many transgressions | cast them | out, *
for they | have re- | belled a- | gainst you.
13. But all who take refuge in you | will be | glad; *
they will | sing out · their | joy for | ever.
14. You will | shelter | them, *
so that those who love your | Name may | exult · in | you.
15. For you, O LORD, will | bless the | righteous; *
you will defend them with your | favor | as · with a | shield.
1. O God, you have cast us | off and | broken us; *
you have been angry; oh, take us | back to | you a- | gain.
2. You have shaken the earth and | split it | open; *
repair the | cracks · in it, | for it | totters.
3. You have made your | people · know | hardship; *
you have given us | wine that | makes us | stagger.
4. You have set up a banner for | those who | fear you, *
to be a refuge from the | power | of the | bow.
5. Save us by your right | hand and | answer us, *
that those who are dear to | you may | be de- | livered.
6. God spoke from his holy | place and | said: *
"I will exult and parcel out Shechem; I will di- | vide the | valley · of | Succoth.
7. Gilead is mine and Man- asseh · is | mine; *
Ephraim is my helmet and | Ju- | dah my | scepter.
8. Moab is my wash-basin, on Edom I throw down my | sandal · to | claim it, *
and over Philistia | I will | shout in | triumph."
9. Who will lead me into the | strong | city? *
who will | bring me | into | Edom?
10. Have you not cast us | off, O | God? *
you no longer go out, O | God, | with our | armies.
11. Grant us your help a- | gainst the | enemy, *
for | vain · is the | help of | man.
12. With God we will do | valiant | deeds, *
and he shall tread our | ene- · mies | under | foot.
1 Hear my | cry, O | God, *
and | listen | to my | prayer.
2 I call upon you from the ends of the earth with heaviness | in my | heart; *
set me upon the | rock · that is | higher · than | I.
3 For you have | been my | refuge, *
a strong | tow'r a- | gainst the | enemy.
4 I will dwell in your | house for | ever; *
I will take refuge under the | cover | of your | wings.
5 For you, O God, have | heard my | vows; *
you have granted me the heritage of | those who | fear your | Name.
6 Add length of days to the | king's | life; *
let his years extend over | many | gener- | ations.
1. For God alone my soul in | silence | waits; *
from | him comes | my sal- | vation.
2. He alone is my rock and | my sal- | vation, *
my stronghold, so that I shall | not be | greatly | shaken.
3. How long will you assail me to crush me, all of | you to- | gether, *
as if you were a leaning | fence, a | toppling | wall.
4. They seek only to bring me down from my | place of | honor; *
lies | are their | chief de- | light.
5. They bless | with their | lips, *
but | in their | hearts they | curse.
6. For God alone my soul in | silence | waits; *
truly, | my hope | is in | him.
7. He alone is my rock and | my sal- | vation, *
my stronghold, so that | I shall | not be | shaken.
8. In God is my safety | and my | honor; *
God is my | strong rock | and my | refuge.
9. Put your trust in him | always, · O | people, *
pour out your hearts before him, for | God | is our | refuge.
10. Those of high degree are but a | fleeting | breath, *
even those of low es- | tate can- | not be | trusted.
11. On the scales they are | lighter · than a | breath, *
all | — of | them to- | gether.
12. Put no trust in extortion; in robbery take no | empty | pride; *
though wealth increase, set | not your | heart up- | on it.
13. God has spoken once, twice | have I | heard it, *
that | pow'r be- | longs to | God.
14. Steadfast love is | yours, O | Lord, *
for you repay everyone ac- | cording | to his | deeds.
1. O God, you are my God; | eager- · ly I | seek you; *
my soul thirsts for you, my flesh faints for you, in a barren and dry land | where there | is no | water.
2. Therefore I have gazed upon you in your | holy | place, *
that I might behold your | pow'r | and your | glory.
3. For your loving-kindness is better than | life it- | self; *
my | lips shall | give your | praise.
4. So will I bless you as | long as · I | live *
and lift up my | hands | in your | Name.
5. My soul is content, as with | marrow · and | fatness, *
and my mouth praises | you with | joyful | lips.
6. When I remember you up- | on my | bed, *
and meditate on you | in the | night | watches.
7. For you have | been my | helper, *
and under the shadow of your | wings I | will re- | joice.
8. My soul | clings to | you; *
your right | hand | holds me | fast.
9. May those who seek my life | to de- | stroy it *
go down to the | depths | of the | earth.
10. Let them fall upon the | edge · of the | sword, *
and let | them be | food for | jackals.
11. But the king will rejoice in God; and those who swear by him | will be | glad; *
for the mouth of those who speak | lies | shall be | stopped.
1. Hear my voice, O God, when | I com- | plain; *
protect my life from | fear | of the | enemy.
2. Hide me from the con- | spiracy · of the | wicked, *
from the | mob of | evil- | doers.
3. They sharpen their tongue | like a | sword, *
and aim their | bitter | words like | arrows.
4. That they may shoot down the | blameless · from | ambush; *
they shoot without warning | and are | not a- | fraid.
5. They hold fast to their | evil | course; *
they plan how | they may | hide their | snares.
6. They say, "Who will see us? who will find | out our | crimes? *
we have thought | out a | perfect | plot."
7. The human mind and heart | are a | mystery; *
but God will loose an arrow at them, and | sudden- · ly | they · will be | wounded.
8. He will make them | trip ov- · er their | tongues, *
and all who | see them · will | shake their | heads.
9. Everyone will stand in awe and de- | clare God's | deeds; *
they | will re- · cog- | nize his | works.
10. The righteous will rejoice in the LORD and put their | trust in | him, *
and all who are | true of | heart will | glory.
1. Be joyful in God, | all you | lands; *
sing the glory of his Name; sing the | glory | of his | praise.
2. Say to God, "How | awesome · are your | deeds! *
because of your great strength your | ene- · mies | cringe be- | fore you.
3. All the earth bows | down be- | fore you, *
sings to | you, sings | out your | Name.
4. Come now and see the | works of | God, *
how wonderful he is in his | doing · to- | ward all | people.
5. He turned the sea into dry land, so that they went through the | water · on | foot, *
and there | we re- | joiced in | him.
6. In his might he rules for ever; his eyes keep watch | over · the | nations; *
let no | rebel · rise | up a- | gainst him.
7. Bless our | God, you | peoples; *
make the voice of his | praise | to be | heard;
8. Who holds our | souls in | life, *
and will not al- | low our | feet to | slip.
9. For you, O | God, have | proved us; *
you have tried us | just as | silver · is | tried.
10. You brought us | into · the | snare; *
you laid heavy | burdens · up- | on our | backs.
11. You let enemies ride over our heads; we went through | fire and | water; *
but you brought us out | into · a | place · of re- | freshment.
12. I will enter your house with burnt-offerings and will pay | you my | vows, *
which I promised with my lips and spoke with my mouth | when I | was in | trouble.
13. I will offer you sacrifices of fat beasts with the | smoke of | rams; *
I will | give you | oxen · and | goats.
14. Come and listen, all you | who fear | God, *
and I will tell you what | he has | done for | me.
15. I called out to him | with my | mouth, *
and his | praise was | on my | tongue.
16. If I had found evil | in my | heart, *
the | Lord would | not have | heard me;
17. But in truth | God has | heard me; *
he has attended to the | voice | of my | prayer.
18. Blessed be God, who has not re- | jected · my | prayer, *
nor with- | held his | love from | me.
1 May God be merciful to | us and | bless us, *
show us the light of his | countenance · and | come to | us.
2 Let your ways be | known up- · on | earth, *
your saving | health a- | mong all | nations.
3 Let the peoples | praise you, · O | God; *
let | all the | peoples | praise you.
4 Let the nations be glad and | sing for | joy, *
for you judge the peoples with equity and guide all the | nations | upon | earth.
5 Let the peoples | praise you, · O | God; *
let | all the | peoples | praise you.
6 The earth has brought | forth her | increase; *
may God, our own | God, give | us his | blessing.
7 May God | give us · his | blessing, *
and may all the ends of the earth | stand in | awe of | him.
1. Let God arise, and let his | enemies · be | scattered; *
let those who | hate him | flee be- | fore him.
2. Let them vanish like smoke when the wind | drives · it a- | way; *
as the wax melts at the fire, so let the wicked perish | at the | presence · of | God.
3. But let the righteous be glad and re- | joice be- · fore | God; *
let them also be | mer- | ry and | joyful.
4. Sing to God, sing praises to his Name; exalt who rides up- | on the | heavens; *
YAHWEH is his | Name, re- | joice be- | fore him!
5. Father of orphans, de- | fender · of | widows, *
God in his | holy | habi- | tation!
6. God gives the solitary a home and brings forth prisoners | into | freedom; *
but the rebels shall | live in | dry | places.
7. O God, when you went forth be- | fore your | people, *
when you | marched | through the | wilderness.
8. The earth shook, and the skies poured down rain, at the presence of God, the | God of | Sinai, *
at the presence of God, the | God of | Israel.
9. You sent a gracious rain, O God, upon | your in- | heritance; *
you refreshed the | land when | it was | weary.
10. Your people | found a | home in it; *
in your goodness, O God, you have made pro- | vision | for the | poor.
11. The Lord | gave the | word; *
great was the company of | women · who | bore the | tidings.
12. "Kings with their armies are | fleeing · a- | way; *
the women at home | are di- | viding · the | spoils."
13. Though you lingered a- | mong the | sheepfolds, *
you shall be like a dover whose wings are covered with silver, whose | feathers · are | like green | gold.
14. When the Almighty | scattered | kings, *
it was like | snow | falling · i- | n Zalmon.
15. O mighty mountain, O | hill of | Bashan! *
O rugged | mountain, · O | hill of | Bashan!
16. Why do you look with envy, O rugged mountain, at the hill which God chose | for his | resting place? *
truly, the | LORD with | dwell · there for | ever.
17. The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even | thousands · of | thousands; *
the Lord comes in | holi- | ness from | Sinai.
18. You have gone up on high and led captivity captive; you have received gifts even | from your | enemies, *
that the LORD | God might | dwell a- | mong them.
19. Blessed be the Lord | day by | day, *
the God of our sal- | vation, · who | bears our | burdens.
20. He is our God, the God of | our sal- | vation; *
God is the LORD, | by whom | we es- · cape | death.
21. God shall crush the | heads · of his | enemies, *
and the hairy scalp of those who | go on | still · in their | wickedness.
22. The LORD has said, "I will bring them | back from | Bashan; *
I will bring them | back · from the | depths · of the | sea.
23. That your foot may be | dipped in | blood, *
the tongues of your gods in the | blood | of your | enemies.
24. They see your pro- | cession, · O | God, *
your procession into the sanctuary, my | God | and my | King.
25. The singers go before, musicians | follow | after, *
in the midst of maidens | playing · up- | on the | hand-drums.
26. Bless God in the | congre- | gation; *
bless the LORD, | you that · are the | fountain · of | Israel.
27. There is Benjamin, least of the tribes, at the head; the princes of Judah | in a | company; *
and the princes of | Zebulon · and | Napthali.
28. Send forth your | strength, O | God; *
establish, O God, what | you have | wrought for | us.
29. Kings shall bring | gifts to | you, *
for your | temple's | sake · at Je- | rusalem.
30. Rebuke the wild | beast · of the | reeds, *
and the peoples, a herd of | wild | bulls · with | its calves.
31. Trample down those who | lust · after | silver; *
scatter the peoples | that de- | light in | war.
32. Let tribute be | brought · out of | Egypt; *
let Ethiopia | stretch · out her | hands to | God.
33. Sing to God, O kingdoms | of the | earth; *
sing | praises | to the | Lord.
34. He rides in the heavens, the | ancient | heavens; *
he sends forth his | voice, his | mighty | voice.
35. Ascribe | pow'r to | God; *
his majesty if over Israel; his | strength is | in the | skies.
36. How wonderful is God in his | holy | places! *
the God of Israel giving strength and power to his | people! | Bless'd be | God!
1. Save | me, O | God, *
for the waters have | risen | up to · my | neck.
2. I am sinking in | deep | mire, *
and there is no | firm ground | for my | feet.
3. I have come into | deep | waters, *
and the | torrent | washes | over me.
4. I have grown weary with my crying; my | throat · is in- | flamed; *
my eyes have failed from | looking | for my | God.
5. Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; my lying foes who would | destroy me · are | mighty. *
Must I then give back | what I | never | stole?
6. O God, you | know my | foolishness, *
and my faults | are not | hidden | from you.
7. Let not those who hope in you be put to shame through me, Lord | GOD of | hosts; *
let not those who seek you be disgraced because of | me, O | God of | Israel.
8. Surely, for your sake have I | suffered · re- | proach, *
and | shame has | covered · my | face.
9. I have become a stranger to my | own | kindred, *
an alien | to my | mother's | children.
10. Zeal for your house has | eaten · me | up; *
the scorn of those who scorn | you has | fallen · up- | on me.
11. I humbled | myself · with | fasting, *
but that was | turned to | my re- | proach.
12. I put on | sack-cloth | also, *
and be- | came a | byword · a- | mong them.
13. Those who sit at the gate | murmur · a- | gainst me, *
and the | drunkards · make | songs a- | bout me.
14. But as for me, this is my | prayer to | you, *
at the | time · you have | set, O | LORD:
15. "In your great | mercy, · O | God, *
answer me with | your un- | failing | help.
16. Save me from the mire; | do not · let me | sink; *
let me be rescued from those who hate me and | out of | deep | waters.
17. Let not the torrent of waters wash over me, neither let the deep | swallow · me | up; *
do not let the Pit | shut its | mouth up- | on me.
18. Answer me, O LORD, for your | love is | kind; *
in your great com- | passion, | turn to | me."
19. "Hide not your | face · from your | servant; *
be swift and answer me, for | I am | in dis- | tress.
20. Draw near to me | and re- | deem me; *
because of my | ene- | mies de- | liver me.
21. You know my reproach, my shame, and | my dis- | honor; *
my adversaries | are all | in your | sight."
22. Reproach has broken my heart, and it | cannot · be | healed; *
I looked for sympathy, but there was none, for comforters, but | I could | find | no one.
23. They gave me | gall to | eat, *
and when I was thirsty, they gave me | vine- | gar to | drink.
24. Let the table before them | be a | trap *
and their | sacred | feasts a | snare.
25. Let their eyes be darkened, that they | may not | see, *
and give them continual | trembling | in their | loins.
26. Pour out your indig- | nation up- | on them, *
and let the fierceness of your | anger | over- | take them.
27. Let their | camp be | desolate, *
and let there be | none to | dwell · in their | tents.
28. For they persecute him whom | they have | stricken *
and add to the pain of | them whom | you have | pierced.
29. Lay to their charge | guilt up- · on | guilt, *
and let them not re- | ceive your | vindi- | cation.
30. Let them be wiped out of the | book · of the | living *
and not be | written · a- | mong the | righteous.
31. As for me, I am afflicted | and in | pain; *
your help, O God, will | lift me | up on | high.
32. I will praise the Name of | God in | song; *
I will proclaim his | greatness | with thanks- | giving.
33. This will please the LORD more than an | offer- · ing of | oxen, *
more than | bullocks · with | horns and | hoofs.
34. The afflicted shall | see · and be | glad; *
you who seek | God, your | heart shall | live.
35. For the LORD listens | to the | needy, *
and his prisoners | he does | not de- | spise.
36. Let the heavens and the | earth | praise him, *
the seas and | all that | moves in | them;
37. For God will save Zion and rebuild the | cities · of | Judah; *
they shall live there and | have it | in pos- | session.
38. The children of his servants | will in- | herit it, *
and those who love his | Name will | dwell there- | in.
1. LORD, do not | rebuke me · in your | anger; *
do not | punish · me | in your | wrath.
2. Have pity on me, LORD, for | I am | weak; *
heal me, LORD, | for my | bones are | racked.
3. My spirit | shakes with | terror; *
how | long, O | LORD, how | long?
4. Turn, O LORD, | and de- | liver me; *
save me | for your | mercy's | sake.
5. For in death | no one · re- | members you; *
and who will | give you | thanks · in the | grave?
6. I grow weary be- | cause of · my | groaning; *
every night I drench my bed and | flood my | couch with | tears.
7. My eyes are | wasted · with | grief *
and wasted a- | way be- | cause · of my | enemies.
8. Depart from me, all | evil- | doers, *
for the LORD has | heard the | sound · of my | weeping.
9. The LORD has heard my | suppli- | cation; *
the | LORD ac- | cepts my | prayer.
10. All my enemies shall be confounded and | quake with | fear; *
they shall turn back and | suddenly · be | put to | shame.
1. Be pleased, O GOD | to de- | liver me; *
O | LORD, make | haste to | help me.
2. Let those who seek my life be ashamed and alto- | gether · dis- mayed; *
let those who take pleasure in my misfortune draw | back and | be dis- | graced.
3. Let those who say to me "Aha!" and gloat over | me turn | back, *
be- | cause they | are a- | shamed.
4. Let all who seek you rejoice and be | glad in | you; *
let those who love your salvation say for | ever, | "Great · is the | LORD!"
5. But as for me, I am | poor and | needy; *
come to me | speedi- | ly, O | God.
6. You are my helper and | my de- | liverer; *
O | LORD, | do not | tarry.
1. In you, O LORD, have I | taken | refuge; *
let me | never | be a- | shamed.
2. In your righteousness, deliver me and | set me | free; *
incline your | ear to | me and | save me.
3. Be my strong rock, a castle to | keep me | safe; *
you are my crag and my stronghold.
4. Deliver me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, *
from the clutches of the evil- | doer | and the · op- | pressor.
5. For you are my hope, | O Lord | GOD, *
my | confi- · dence | since · I was | young.
6. I have been sustained by you ever since I was born; from my mother's womb you have | been my | strength; *
my | praise shall | be al- · ways of | you.
7. I have become a | portent · to | many; *
but you are my | refuge | and my | strength.
8. Let my mouth be | full · of your | praise *
and your | glory | all the · day | long.
9. Do not cast me off in | my old | age; *
forsake me not | when my | strength | fails.
10. For my enemies are | talking · a- | gainst me, *
and those who lie in wait for my | life take | counsel · to- | gether.
11. They say, "God has forsaken him; go after | him and | seize him; *
because there | is none | who will | save."
12. O God, be not | far from | me; *
come quickly to | help me, | O my | God.
13. Let those who set themselves against me be put to | shame · and dis- | graced; *
let those who seek to do me evil be | covered · with | scorn · and re- | proach.
14. But I shall always | wait in | patience, *
and shall | praise you | more and | more.
15. My mouth shall recount your mighty acts and saving deeds | all day | long; *
though I cannot | know the | number | of them.
16. I will begin with the mighty works | of the · Lord | GOD; *
I will recall your | righteous- · ness, | yours a- | lone.
17. O God, you have taught me since | I was | young, *
and to this day I | tell · of your | wonder- · ful | works.
18. And now that I am old and gray-headed, O God, do | not for- | sake me, *
till I make known your strength to this generation and your power to | all who | are to | come.
19. Your righteousness, O God, | reaches · to the | heavens; *
you have done great things; | who is · like | you, O | God?
20. You have showed me great | troubles · and ad- | versities, *
but you will restore my life, and bring me up again from the deep | places | of the | earth.
21. You strengthen me | more and | more; *
you en- | fold and | comfort | me.
22. Therefore I will praise you upon the lyre for your faithfulness, | O my | God; *
I will sing to you with the harp, O | Holy | One of | Israel.
23. My lips will sing with joy when I | play to | you, *
and so will my soul, | which you | have re- | deemed.
24. My tongue will proclaim your righteousness | all day | long, *
for they are ashamed and disgraced who | sought to | do me | harm.
1. Give the king your | justice, · O | God, *
and your | righteous- · ness | to the | King's Son;
2. That he may rule your | people | righteously *
and | — the | poor with | justice.
3. That the mountains may bring prosperity | to the | people, *
and the | little | hills bring | righteousness.
4. He shall defend the needy a- | mong the | people; *
he shall rescue the | poor and | crush · the op- | pressor.
5. He shall live as long as the sun and | moon en- | dure, *
from one gener- | ation | to an- | other.
6. He shall come down like rain up- | on the · mown | field, *
like | show'rs that | water · the | earth.
7. In his time shall the | righteous | flourish; *
there shall be abundance of peace till the | moon shall | be no | more.
8. He shall rule from | sea to | sea, *
and from the River | to the | ends · of the | earth.
9. His foes shall bow | down be- | fore him, *
and his | ene- · mies | lick the | dust.
10. The kings of Tarshish and the | isles shall · pay | tribute, *
and the kings of Arabia and | Saba | offer | gifts.
11. All kings shall bow | down be- | fore him *
and all the | nations | do him | service.
12. For he shall deliver the poor who | cries out · in dis- | tress, *
and the op- | pressed who | has no | helper.
13. He shall have pity on the | lowly · and | poor; *
he shall pre- | serve the | lives · of the | needy.
14. He shall redeem their lives from op- | pression · and | violence, *
and dear shall their | blood be | in his | sight.
15. Long may he live! and may there be given to him | gold from | Arabia; *
may prayer be made for him always, and mat they | bless him | all the · day | long.
16. May there be abundance of grain on the earth, growing thick | even · on the | hilltops; *
may its fruit flourish like Lebanon, and its grain like | grass up- | on the | earth.
17. May his name remain for ever, and be established as long as the | sun en- | dures; *
may all the nations bless themselves in | him and | call him | bless'd.
18. Blessed be the Lord GOD, the | God of | Israel, *
who a- | lone does | wondrous | deeds!
19. And blessed be his glorious | Name for | ever! *
and may all the earth be filled with his | glory. · A- | men. A- | men.
1. Truly, God is | good to | Israel, *
to those | who are | pure in | heart.
2. But as for me, my feet had | nearly | slipped; *
I had almost | tripped and | fallen.
3. Because I | envied · the | proud *
and saw the pros- | peri- · ty | of the | wicked.
4. For they | suffer · no | pain, *
and their | bodies · are | sleek and | sound;
5. In the misfortunes of others they | have no | share; *
they are not af- | flicted · as | others | are;
6. Therefore they wear their pride | like a | necklace *
and wrap their violence a- | bout them | like a | cloak.
7. Their iniquity comes from | gross | minds, *
and their hearts over- | flow with | wicked | thoughts.
8. They scoff and | speak mal- | iciously; *
out of their | haughti- · ness they | plan op- | pression.
9. They set their minds a- | gainst the | heavens, *
and their evil | speech runs | through the | world.
10. And so the people | turn to | them *
and | find in | them no | fault.
11. They say, "How | should God | know? *
is there | knowledge · in | the Most | High?"
12. So then, these are the wicked; *
always at ease, they increase their wealth.
13. In vain have I kept my | heart | clean, *
and | washed my | hands in | innocence.
14. I have been afflicted | all day | long, *
and | punished | ev'ry | morning.
15. Had I gone on | speaking · this | way, *
I should have betrayed the gener- | ation | of your | children.
16. When I tried to under- | stand new | things, *
it | was too | hard for | me.
17. Until I entered the sanctu- | ary · of | God *
and discovered the | end | of the | wicked.
18. Surely, you set them in | slipp'ry | places; *
you | cast them | own in | ruin.
19. Oh, how suddenly do they | come to · de- | struction, *
come to an end, and | per- | ish from | terror!
20. Like a dream when one a- | wakens, · O | Lord, *
when you arise you will | make their | image | vanish.
21. When my mind be- | came em- | bittered, *
I was sorely | wounded | in my | heart.
22. I was stupid and had no | under- | standing; *
I was like a brute | beast | in your | presence.
23. Yet I am | always | with you; *
you hold me | by my | right | hand.
24. You will guide me | by your | counsel, *
and afterwards re- | ceive | me in | glory.
25. Whom have I in | heav'n but | you? *
and having you I desire | nothing | upon | earth.
26. Though my flesh and my heart should | waste a- | way, *
God is the strength of my heart and my | por- | tion for | ever.
27. Truly, those who forsake | you will | perish; *
you destroy | all who | are un- | faithful.
28. But it is good for me to be | near | God; *
I have made the | Lord | GOD my | refuge.
29. I will speak of | all your | works *
in the | gates · of the | city · of | Zion.
1. O God, why have you utterly | cast us | off? *
why is your wrath so hot a- | gainst the | sheep · of your | pasture?
2. Remember your congregation that you purchased | long a- | go, *
the tribe you redeemed to be your inheritance, and Mount | Zion | where you | dwell.
3. Turn your step toward the | endless | ruins; *
the enemy has laid waste | every- · thing | in your | sanctuary.
4. Your adversaries roared in your | holy | place; *
they set up their banners as | to- | kens of | victory.
5. They were like men coming up with axes to a | grove of · old | trees; *
they broke down all your carved work with | hatch- | ets and | hammers.
6. They set fire to your | holy | place; *
they defiled the dwelling-place of your Name and | razed it | to the | ground.
7. They said to themselves, "Let us destroy them | alto- | gether." *
They burned down all the meeting-places of | God | in the | land.
8. There are no signs for us to see; there is no | prophet | left; *
there is not one among | us who | knows how | long.
9. How long, O God, will the | ene- · my | scoff? *
will the enemy blas- | pheme your | Name for | ever.
10. Why do you draw | back your | hand? *
why is your right hand | hidden | in your | bosom?
11. Yet God is my King from | ancient | times, *
victorious in the | midst | of the | earth.
12. You divided the sea | by your | might *
and shattered the heads of the | dragons · up- | on the | waters.
13. You crushed the | heads of | Leviathan *
and gave him to the | people · of the | desert · for | food.
14. You split open the | spring and | torrent; *
you dried up | ever- | flowing | rivers.
15. Yours is the day, yours | also · the | night; *
you established the | moon | and the | sun.
16. You fixed all the boundaries | of the | earth; *
you | made both | summer · and | winter.
17. Remember, O Lord, how the | ene- · my | scoffed, *
how a foolish | people · de- | spised your | Name.
18. Do not hand over the life of your | dove to · wild | beasts; *
never for- | get the | lives · of your | poor.
19. Look up- | on your | covenant; *
the dark places of the | earth are | haunts of | violence.
20. Let not the oppressed turn | away | ashamed; *
let the poor and | needy | praise your | Name.
21. Arise, O God, main- | tain your | cause; *
remember how fools re- | vile you | all day | long.
22. Forget not the clamor | of your | adversaries; *
the unending tumult of those | who rise | up a- | gainst you.
1. We give thanks, O God, we | give you | thanks; *
calling upon your wonderful Name and declaring | all your | wonder- · ful | deeds.
2. "I will appoint a | time," says | God; *
"I | will | judge with | equity."
3. Though the earth and its inhabi- | tants are | quaking, *
I will | make its | pillars | fast.
4. I will say to the boasters, | 'Boast no | more,' *
and to the wicked, | 'Do not | toss your | horns;
5. Do not toss your | horns so | high, *
nor | speak · with a | proud | neck.'"
6. For judgment is neither from the east nor | from the | west, *
nor yet from the | wilder- · ness | or the | mountains.
7. It is | God who | judges; *
he puts down one | and lifts | up an- | other.
8. For in the LORD's hand there is a cup, full of spiced and foaming wine, which | he pours | out, *
and all the wicked of the earth shall | drink and | drain the | dregs.
9. But I will re- | joice for | ever; *
I will sing praises | to the | God of | Jacob.
10. He shall break the | horns · of the | wicked; *
but the horns of the | righteous | shall · be ex- | alted.
1. In Judah | is God | known; *
his | Name is | great in | Israel.
2. At Salem | is his | tabernacle, *
and his | dwelling | is in | Zion.
3. There he broke the | flashing | arrows, *
the shield, the sword, | and the | weapons · of | battle.
4. How glor- | ious · you | are! *
more splendid than the | ever- | lasting | mountains!
5. The strong of heart have been despoiled; they | sink · into | sleep; *
none of the | warriors · can | lift a | hand.
6. At your rebuke, O | God of | Jacob, *
both | horse and | rider · lie | stunned.
7. What terror | you in- | spire! *
who can stand be- | fore you · when | you are | angry?
8. From heaven you pro- | nounced | judgment; *
the earth | was af- | raid · and was | still;
9. When God rose | up in | judgment *
and to save all the op- | pressed | of the | earth.
10. Truly, wrathful Edom will | give you | thanks, *
and the remnant of | Hamath · will | keep your | feasts.
11. Make a vow to the LORD your | God and | keep it; *
let all around him bring gifts to him who is | worthy | to be | feared.
12. He breaks the | spirit · of | princes, *
and strikes | terror · in the | kings · of the | earth.
1. I will cry a- | loud to | God; *
I will cry a- | loud and | he will | hear me.
2. In the day of trouble I | sought the | Lord; *
my hands were stretched out by night and did not tire; I re- | fus'd | to be | comforted.
3. I think of God, | I am | restless, *
I ponder, | and my | spirit | faints.
4. You will not let my | eyelids | close; *
I am troubled | and I | cannot | speak.
5. I consider the | days of | old; *
I re- | member · the | years long | past;
6. I commune with my | heart · in the | night; *
I | ponder · and | search my | mind.
7. Will the Lord cast me | off for | ever? *
Will he | no more | show his | favor?
8. Has his loving-kindness come to an | end for | ever? *
has his promise | failed for | ever- | more?
9. Has God for- | gotten to be | gracious? *
has he, in his | anger, · with- | held · his com- | passion?
10. And I said, "My | grief is | this: *
the right hand of the Most | High has | lost its | power."
11. I will remember the | works · of the | LORD, *
and call to mind your | won- | ders of | old time.
12. I will meditate on | all your | acts *
and | ponder · your | mighty | deeds.
13. Your way, O | God, is | holy; *
who is so | great a | god as | our God.
14. You are the God who | works | wonders *
and have declared your | pow'r a- | mong the | peoples.
15. By your strength you have re- | deemed your | people, *
the | children · of | Jacob · and | Joseph.
16. The waters saw you, O God; the waters | saw you · and | trembled; *
the | very | depths were | shaken.
17. The clouds poured out water; the | skies | thundered; *
your arrows | flash'd | to and | fro.
18. The sound of your thunder was in the whirlwind; your lightnings | lit up · the | world; *
the | earth | trembled · and | shook.
19. Your way was in the sea, and your paths in the | great | waters, *
yet your | footsteps | were not | seen.
20. You led your people | like a | flock *
by the | hand of | Moses · and | Aaron.
1. Hear my teaching, | O my | people; *
incline your | ears · to the | words · of my | mouth.
2. I will open my | mouth · in a | parable; *
I will declare the | myster- · ies of | ancient | times.
3. That which we have heard and known, and what our | fathers · have | told us, *
we | will not | hide · from their | children.
4. We will recount to generations to come the praiseworthy deeds and the | power · of the | LORD, *
and the | wonder- · ful | works · he has | done.
5. He gave his decrees to Jacob and established a | law for | Israel, *
which he commanded | them to | teach their | children.
6. That the generations might know and the children | yet un- | born; *
that they in their turn might | tell it | to their | children.
7. So that they might put their | trust in | God, *
and not forget the deeds of God, but | keep | his com- | mandments.
8. And not be like their forefathers, a stubborn and re- | bellious · gen- | eration, *
a generation whose heart was not subdued, and whose spirit | was not | faithful · to | God.
9. The people of Ephraim, | armed · with the | bow, *
turned | back · in the | day of | battle.
10. They did not keep the | cove- · nant of | God, *
and refused to | walk · in his | law.
11. They forgot what | he had | done, *
and the | wonders | he had | shown them.
12. He worked marvels in the | sight · of their | forefathers, *
in the land of Egypt, | in the | field of | Zoan.
13. He split open the sea and | let them · pass | through; *
he made the | waters · stand | up like | walls.
14. He led them with a | cloud by | day, *
and all the night through | with a | glow of | fire.
15. He split the hard rocks | in the | wilderness *
and gave them drink as | from the | great | deep.
16. He brought streams | out of · the | cliff, *
and the waters | gushed | out like | rivers.
17. But they went on | sinning · a- | gainst him, *
rebelling in the desert a- | gainst the | Most | High.
18. They tested God | in their | hearts, *
demanding | food · for their | craving.
19. They railed against | God and | said, *
"Can God set a | table | in the | wilderness?
20. True, he struck the rock, the waters gushed out, and the gullies | over- | flowed; *
but is he able to give bread or | to pro- · vide | meat · for his | people?"
21. When the LORD heard this, he was | full of | wrath; *
a fire was kindled against Jacob, and his anger | mounted | against | Israel;
22. For they had no | faith in | God, *
nor did they put their trust | in his | saving | power.
23. So he commanded the | clouds a- | bove *
and | opened · the | doors of | heaven.
24. He rained down manna upon | them to | eat *
and | gave them | grain from | heaven.
25. So mortals ate the | bread of | angels; *
he provided for | them | food e- | nough.
26. He caused the east wind to | blow · in the | heavens *
and led out the | south wind | by his | might.
27. He rained down flesh up- | on them · like | dust *
and winged birds | like the | sand · of the | sea.
28. He let it fall in the | midst · of their | camp *
and | round a- | bout their | dwellings.
29. So they ate and were | well | filled, *
for he | gave them | what they | craved.
30. But they did not | stop their | craving, *
though the | food was | still · in their | mouths.
31. So God's anger | mounted · a- | gainst them; *
he slew their strongest men and laid | low the | youth of | Israel.
32. In spite of all this, they | went on | sinning *
and had no faith | in his | wonder- · ful | works.
33. So he brought their days to an end | like a | breath *
and their | years in | sudden | terror.
34 Whenever he slew them, | they would | seek him, *
and repent, and | dili- · gently | search for | God.·
35. They would remember that | God was · their | rock, *
and the | Most High | God · their re- | deemer.
36. But they flattered him | with their | mouths *
and | lied to · him | with their | tongues.
37. Their heart was not | steadfast · to- | ward him, *
and they were not | faithful | to his | covenant.
38. But he was so merciful that he forgave their sins an- | d did | not de- | stroy them; *
many times he held back his anger and did not per- | mit his | wrath · to be | roused.
39. For he remembered that they | were but flesh, *
a breath that goes forth | and does | not re- | turn.
40. How often the people disobeyed him | in the | wilderness *
and of- | fended · him | in the | desert!
41. Again and again they | tempted | God *
and provoked the | Holy | One of | Israel.
42. They did not re- | member · his | power *
in the day when he | ransomed | them · from the | enemy.
43. How he wrought his | signs in | Egypt *
and his omens | in the | field of | Zoan.
44. He turned their | rivers · into | blood, *
so that they | could not | drink · of their | streams.
45. He sent swarms of flies among them, which | ate them | up, *
and frogs, | which des- | troyed | them.
46. He gave their | crops · to the | caterpillar, *
the | fruit · of their | toil · to the | locust.
47. He killed their | vines with | hail *
and their | syca- | mores with | frost.
48. He delivered their | cattle · to | hailstones *
and their | livestock | to his | thunderbolts
49. He poured out upon them his | blazing | anger: *
fury, indignation, and distress, a | troop of | blazing | angels.
50. He gave full rein to his anger; he did not spare their | souls from | death; *
but delivered their | lives | to the | plague.
51. He struck down all the | firstborn | of Egypt, *
the flower of manhood | in the | dwellings · of | Ham.
52. He led out his | people · like | sheep *
and guided them in the | wilder- · ness | like a | flock.
53. He led them to safety, and they | were · not a- | fraid; *
but the sea | over- | whelmed their | enemies.
54. He brought them to his | holy | land, *
the mountain | his right | hand had | won.
55. He drove out the Canaanites before them and apportioned an inheritance to | them by | lot; *
he made the tribes of | Israel · to | dwell · in their | tents.
56. But they tested the Most High God, and | defied | him, *
and did | not keep | his com- | mandments.
57. They turned away and were disloyal | like their | fathers; *
they were undependable like a | warped | bow.
58. They grieved him with | their hill- | altars *
and provoked his dis- | pleasure | with their | idols.
59. When God heard this, | he was | angry *
and | utter- · ly re- | jected | Israel.
60. He forsook the | shrine at | Shiloh, *
the tabernacle where he had | lived a- | mong his | people.
61. He delivered the ark | into cap- | tivity, *
his glory into the | adver- | sary's | hand.
62. He gave his people | to the | sword *
and was | angered · a- | gainst his · in- | heritance.
63. The fire con- | sumed · their young | men; *
there were | no · wedding | songs · for their | maidens.
64. Their priests | fell · by the | sword, *
and their widows | made no | lamen- | tation.
65. Then the LORD woke as though | from a | sleep, *
like a | warrior · re- | freshed with | wine.
66. He struck his | ene- · mies | on the | backside *
and put them | to per- | petual | shame.
67. He rejected the | tent of | Joseph *
and did not | choose the | tribe of | Ephraim.
68. He chose instead the | tribe of | Judah *
and Mount | Zion, | which he | loved.
69. He built his sanctuary like the | heights of | heaven, *
like the earth | which he | founded · for | ever.
70. He chose | David · his | servant, *
and took him a- | way | from the | sheepfolds.
71. He brought him from | follow- · ing the | ewes, *
to be a shepherd over Jacob his people and over | Israel | his in- | heritance.
72. So he shepherded them with a faithful and | true | heart *
and guided them with the | skillful- · ness | of his | hands.
1. O God, the heathen have come into your inheritance; they have profaned your | holy | temple; *
they have made Jerusa- | lem a | heap of | rubble.
2. They have given the bodies of your servants as food for the | birds · of the | air, *
and the flesh of your faithful ones to the | beasts | of the | field.
3. They have shed their blood like water on every | side · of Je- | rusalem, *
and there was | no one · to | bury | them.
4. We have become a reproach | to our | neighbors, *
an object of scorn and de- | rision · to | those a- | round us.
5. How long will you be | angry, · O | LORD? *
will your fury | blaze like | fire for | ever?
6. Pour out your wrath upon the heathen who | have not | known you *
and upon the kingdoms that have not | called up- | on your | Name.
7. For they have de- | vour'd | Jacob *
and | made his | dwelling · a | ruin.
8. Remember not our past sins; let your compassio be | swift to | meet us; *
for we have been | brought | very | low.
9. Help us, O God our Savior, for the | glory · of your | Name; *
deliver us and forgive us our | sins, for | your Name's | sake.
10. Why should the heathen say, "Where | is their | God?" *
Let it be known among the heathen and in our sight that you avenge the shedding | of your | servants' | blood.
11. Let the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners | come be- | fore you, *
and by your great might spare those who | are con- | demned to | die.
12. May the revilings with which they reviled | you, O | Lord, *
return | seven- · fold | into · their | bosoms.
13. For we are your people and the | sheep of · your | pasture; *
we will give you thanks for ever and show forth your | praise from | age to | age.
1. O LORD my God, I take | refuge · in | you; *
save and | deliver me · from | all who · pur-sue me.
2. Lest like a lion they | tear me · in | pieces *
and snatch me a- | way with | none to · de- | liver me.
3. O LORD my God, if I have | done these | things; *
if there is any | wicked- · ness | in my | hands,
4. If I have repaid my | friend with | evil, *
or plundered him who without | cause | is my | enemy;
5. Then let my enemy pursue and | over- | take me, *
trample my life into the ground, and lay my | honor | in the | dust.
6. Stand up, O LORD, | in your | wrath; *
rise up against the | fury | of my | enemies.
7. Awake, O my God, de- | cree | justice; *
let the assembly of the | peoples | gather · round | me.
8. Be seated on your lofty throne, | O Most | High; *
O | LORD | judge the | nations.
9. Give judgment for me according to my | righteous- · ness, O | LORD, *
and according to my | inno- · cence, | O Most | High.
10. Let the malice of the wicked come to an end, but e- | stablish · the | righteous; *
for you test the mind and | heart, O | righteous | God.
11. God is my shield | and de- | fense; *
he is the savior | of the | true in | heart.
12. God is a | righteous | judge; *
God sits in | judgment | every | day.
13. If they will not repent, God will | whet his | sword; *
he will bend his | bow and | make it | ready.
14. He has prepared his | weapons · of | death; *
he makes his | arrows | shafts of | fire.
15. Look at those who are in | labor · with | wickedness, *
who conceive evil, and | give birth | to a | lie.
16. They dig a pit and | make it | deep *
and fall into the | hole that | they have | made.
17. Their malice turns back upon | their own | head; *
their violence | falls on | their own | scalp.
18. I will bear witness that the | LORD is | righteous; *
I will praise the | Name · of the | LORD Most | High.
1. Hear, O Shepherd of Israel, leading Joseph | like a | flock; *
shine forth, you that are en- | throned up- | on the | cherubim.
2. In the presence of Ephraim, Benjamin | and Man- | asseh, *
stir up your | strength and | come to | help us.
3. Restore us, O | God of | hosts; *
show the light of your countenance, | and we | shall be | saved.
4. O LORD | God of | hosts, *
how long will you be angered de- | spite the | prayers · of your | people?
5. You have fed them with the | bread of | tears; *
you have given them | bowls of | tears to | drink.
6. You have made us the derision | of our | neighbors, *
and our | ene- · mies | laugh us · to | scorn.
7. Restore us, O | God of | hosts; *
show the light of your countenance, | and we | shall be | saved.
8. You have brought a vine | out of | Egypt; *
you cast out the | nations · and | planted | it.
9. You prepared the | ground | for it; *
it took | root and | filled the | land.
10. The mountains were covered | by its | shadow *
and the towering | cedar · trees | by its | boughs.
11. You stretched out its tendrils | to the | Sea *
and its | branches | to the | River.
12. Why have you broken | down its | wall, *
so that all who | pass by | pluck its | grapes.
13. The wild boar of the forest has | ravaged | it, *
and the beasts of the | field have | grazed up- | on it.
14. Turn now, O God of hosts, look down from heaven; behold and | tend this | vine; *
preserve what | your right | hand has | planted.
15. They burn it with | fire like | rubbish; *
at the rebuke of your | counte- · nance | let them | perish.
16. Let your right hand be upon the man of | your right | hand, *
the son of man you have | made so | strong · for your- | self.
17. And so will we never turn a- | way from | you; *
give us life, that we may | call up- | on your | Name.
18. Restore us, O | God of | hosts; *
show the light of your countenance, | and we | shall be | saved.
1. Sing with joy to | God our | strength *
and raise a loud | shout · to the | God of | Jacob.
2. Raise a song and | sound the | timbrel, *
the | merry · harp, | and the | lyre.
3. Blow the ram's-horn | at the | new moon, *
and at the full moon, the | day | of our | feast.
4. For this is a | statute · for | Israel, *
a | law · of the | God of | Jacob.
5. He laid it as a solemn charge up- | on Jo- | seph, *
when he came | out · of the | land of | Egypt.
6. I heard an un- | familiar · voice | saying, *
"I eased his shoulder from the burden; his hands were set | free from | bearing · the | load."
7. You called on me in trouble, and | I saved | you; *
I answered you from the secret place of thunder and tested you | at the | waters · of | Meribah.
8. Hear, O my people, and I | will ad- | monish you: *
O Israel, if you | would but | listen · to | me!
9. There shall be no strange | god a- | mong you; *
you shall not | worship · a | foreign | god.
10. I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of | Egypt · and | said, *
"Open your mouth | wide, and | I will | fill it."
11. And yet my people did not | hear my | voice, *
and | Israel · would | not o- | bey me.
12. So I gave them over to the | stubbornness · of their | hearts, *
to | follow · their | own de- | vices.
13. Oh, that my people would | listen · to | me! *
that | Israel · would | walk · in my | ways.
14. I should soon sub- | due their | enemies *
and turn my | hand a- | gainst their | foes.
15. Those who hate the LORD would | cringe be- | fore him, *
and their | punish- · ment would | last for | ever.
16. But Israel would I feed with the | finest | wheat *
and satisfy him with | honey | from the | rock.
1. God takes his stand in the | council · of | heaven; *
he gives judgment | in the | midst · of the | gods.
2. "How long will you | judge un- | justly, *
and show | favor | to the | wicked?
3. Save the weak | and the | orphan; *
defend the | hum- | ble and | needy;
4. Rescue the | weak · and the | poor; *
deliver them from the | pow'r | of the | wicked.
5. They do not know; neither do they understand; they go a- | bout in | darkness; *
all the foundations | of the | earth are | shaken.
6. Now I say to you, | 'You are | gods, *
and all of you children | of the | Most | High;
7. Nevertheless, you shall | die like | mortals, *
and | fall like | any | prince.'"
8. Arise, O God, and | rule the | earth, *
for you shall take all | nations | for your | own.
1. O God, do | not be | silent; *
do not keep still nor | hold your | peace, O | God;
2. For your enemies | are in | tumult, *
and those who hate you have | lifted | up their | heads.
3. They take secret counsel a- | gainst your | people *
and plot against | those whom | you pro- | tect.
4. They have said, "Come, let us wipe them out from a- | mong the | nations; *
let the name of Israel | be re- | membered · no | more."
5. They have con- | spired to- | gether; *
they have | made · an al- | liance a- | gainst you.
6. The tents of Edom | and the | Ishmaelites; *
the Moabites | and the | Hagar- | enes;
7. Gebal, and | Ammon, · and | Amalek; *
the Philistines and | those who | dwell in | Tyre.
8. The Assyrians | also · have | joined them, *
and have come to | help the | people · of | Lot.
9. Do to them as you | did to | Midian, *
to Sisera, and to Jabin at the | riv- | er of | Kishon:
10. They were des- | troyed at | Endor; *
they became like | dung up- | on the | ground.
11. Make their leaders like | Oreb and · Ze- | eb, *
and all their commanders | like · Zebah | and · Zalmun- | na,
12. Who said, "Let us | take · for our- | selves *
the fields of | God as | our pos- | session."
13. O my God, make them like | whirling | dust *
and like | chaff be- | fore the | wind.
14. Like fire that burns | down a | forest, *
like the flame that | sets a | mountain · a- | blaze.
15. Drive them | with your | tempest *
and | terri- · fy | them · with your | storm.
16. Cover their faces with | shame, O | LORD, *
that | they may | seek your | Name.
17. Let them be disgraced and | terri- · fied for | ever; *
let them be put to con- | fu- | sion and | perish.
18. Let them know you, whose | Name is | YAHWEH, *
you alone are the Most High | over | all the | earth.
1 How dear to me is your dwelling, O | LORD of | hosts! *
My soul has a desire and longing for the courts of the LORD; my heart and my flesh re- | joice · in the | living | God.
2 The sparrow has found her a house and the swallow a nest where she may | lay her | young; *
by the side of your altars, O LORD of hosts, my | King | and my | God.
3 Happy are they who | dwell in · your | house! *
they will | always · be | praising | you.
4 Happy are the people whose | strength · is in | you! *
whose hearts are | set · on the | pilgrims' | way.
5 Those who go through the desolate valley will find it a | place of | springs, *
for the early rains have | covered · it with | pools of | water.
6 They will climb from | height to | height, *
and the God of gods will re- | veal him- | self in | Zion.
7 LORD God of hosts, | hear my | prayer; *
hear- | ken, O | God of | Jacob.
8 Behold our de- | fender, · O | God; *
and look upon the | face of | your An- | ointed.
9 For one day in your courts is better than a thousand in | my own | room, *
and to stand at the threshold of the house of my God than to dwell | in the · tents | of the | wicked.
10 For the LORD God is both | sun and | shield; *
he will | give | grace and | glory;
11 No good thing will the | LORD with- | hold *
from those who | walk | with in- | tegrity.
12 O | LORD of | hosts, *
happy are they who | put their | trust in | you!
1. You have been gracious to your | land, O | LORD, *
you have restored | the good | fortune — | of Jacob.
2. You have forgotten the iniquity | of your | people *
and | blotted · out | all their | sins.
3. You have withdrawn | all your | fury *
and turned yourself from your | wrathful | indig- | nation.
4. Restore us then, O | God our | Savior; *
let your | anger · de- | part from | us.
5. Will you be displeased with | us for | ever? *
will you prolong your | anger · from | age to | age?
6. Will you not give us | life a- | gain, *
that your people | may re- | joice in | you?
7. Show us your | mercy, · O | LORD, *
and | grant us | your sal- | vation.
8. I will listen to what the LORD | God is | saying, *
for he is speaking peace to his faithful people and to those who | turn their | hearts to | him.
9. Truly, his salvation is very n ear to | those who | fear him, *
that his | glory · may | dwell · in our | land.
10. Mercy and truth are | met to- | gether; *
righteousness and | peace have | kissed each | other.
11. Truth shall spring up | from the | earth, *
and righteousness | shall look | down from | heaven.
12. The LORD will indeed | grant pros- | perity, *
and our | land will | yield its | increase.
13. Righteousness shall | go be- | fore him, *
and peace shall be a | pathway | for his | feet.
1. Bow down your ear, O | LORD, and | answer me, *
for I am | poor | and in | misery.
2. Keep watch over my life, for | I am | faithful; *
save your servant who | puts his | trust in | you.
3. Be merciful to me, O LORD, for | you are · my | God; *
I call up- | on you | all the · day | long.
4. Gladden the | soul of · your | servant, *
for to you, O | LORD, I | lift · up my | soul.
5. For you, O LORD, are | good and | forgiving, *
and great is your love toward | all who | call up- | on you.
6. Give ear, O LORD, | to my | prayer, *
and attend to the | voice · of my | suppli- | cation.
7. In the time of my trouble, I will | call up- | on you, *
for | you will | answer | me.
8. Among the gods there is no one like | you, O | LORD, *
nor | any- · thing | like your | works.
9. All nations you have made will come and worship | you, O | LORD, *
slow to anger, and | full of | kindness · and | truth.
10. For you are great; you do | wondrous | things; *
and | glori- | fy your | Name.
11. Teach me your way, O LORD, and I will | walk in · your | truth; *
knit my heart to you that I may fear your Name.
12. I will thank you, O LORD my God, with | all my | heart, *
and glorify your | Name for | ever- | more.
13. For great is your love | toward | me; *
you have delivered me | from the | nether- | — most | Pit.
14. The arrogant rise up against me, O God, and a band of violent men | seeks my | life; *
they have not | set you · be- | fore their | eyes.
15. But you, O LORD, are gracious and | full of · com- | passion, *
slow to anger, and | full of | kindness · and | truth.
16. Turn to me and have | mercy · up- | on me; *
give your strength to your servant; and | save the | child · of your | handmaid.
17. Show me a sign of your favor, so that those who hate me may see it and be ashamed; *
because you, O LORD, have | helped · me and | com- · forted | me.
1. On the holy mountain stands the city | he has | founded; *
the LORD loves the gates of Zion more than | all the | dwellings · of | Jacob.
2. Glorious things are | spoken | of you, *
O | city | of our | God.
3. I count Egypt and Babylon among | those who | know me; *
in | Zion | were they | born.
4. Of Zion it shall be said, "Everyone was | born in | her, *
and the Most High him- | self | shall sus- | tain her."
5. The LORD will record as he en- | rolls the | peoples, *
"These | also · were | born | there."
6. The singers and | dancers · will | say, *
"All | my fresh | springs are | in you."
1. O LORD, my | God, my | Savior, *
by day and | night I | cry to | you.
2. Let my prayer enter | into · your | presence; *
incline your | ear · to my | lament- | ation.
3. For I am | full of | trouble; *
my life is | at the | brink · of the | grave.
4. I am counted among those who go | down · to the | Pit; *
I have become like | one who | has no | strength;
5. Lost a- | mong the | dead, *
like the | slain who | lie · in the | grave,
6. Whom you re- | member · no | more, *
for they are cut | off | from your | hand.
7. You have laid me in the | depths · of the | Pit, *
in dark places, | and in | the ab- | yss.
8. Your anger weighs up- | on me | heavily, *
and all your great | waves | over- | whelm me.
9. You have put my friends far from me; you have made me to be ab- | horred by | them; *
I am in | prison · and | cannot · get | free.
10. My sight has failed me be- | cause of | trouble; *
LORD, I have called upon you daily; I have | stretched out · my | hands to | you.
11. Do you not work | wonders · for the | dead? *
will those who have died stand | up and | give you | thanks?
12. Will your loving-kindness be de- | clared · in the | grave? *
your faithfulness | in the | land · of de- | struction?
13. Will your wonders be | known · in the | dark? *
or your righteousness in the | country · where | all · is for- | gotten?
14. But as for me, O LORD, I cry to | you for | help; *
in the morning my | prayer | comes be- | fore you.
15. LORD, why have you | rejected | me? *
why have you | hidden · your | face from | me?
16. Ever since my youth, I have been wretched and at the | point of | death; *
I have borne your terrors | with a | troubled | mind.
17. Your blazing anger has swept | over | me; *
your | terrors | have des- | troyed me.
18. They surround me all day long | like a | flood; *
they encompass | me on | ev'ry | side.
19. My friend and my neighbor you have put a- | way from | me, *
and darkness | is my | only · com- | panion.
1. Your love, O LORD, for ever | will I | sing; *
from age to age my mouth | will pro- | claim your | faithfulness.
2. For I am persuaded that your love is es- | tablished · for | ever; *
you have set your faithfulness | firmly | in the | heavens.
3. "I have made a covenant with my | chosen | one; *
I have sworn an | oath to | David · my | servant:
4. 'I will establish your | line for | ever, *
and preserve your | throne for | all · gener- | ations.'"
5. The heavens bear witness to your | wonders, · O | LORD, *
and to your faithfulness in the assembly | of the | holy | ones;
6. For who in the skies can be com- | pared · to the | LORD? *
who is like the | LORD a- | mong the | gods?
7. God is much to be feared in the council of the | holy | ones, *
great and terrible to | all | those a- | round him.
8. Who is like you, LORD | God | of hosts? *
O mighty LORD, your | faithful- · ness is | all a- | round you.
9. You rule the | raging · of the | sea *
and still the | surging | of its | waves.
10. You have crushed Rahab of the deep with a | deadly | wound; *
you have scattered your enemies | with your | mighty | arm.
11. Yours are the heavens; the earth | also · is | yours; *
you laid the foundations of the world and | all that | is in | it.
12. You have made the north | and the | south; *
Tabor and Hermon re- | joice | in your | Name.
13. You have a | mighty | arm; *
strong is your hand and | high is | your right | hand.
14. Righteousness and justice are the foundations | of your | throne; *
love and truth | go be- | fore your | face.
15. Happy are the people who know the | festal | shout! *
they walk, O LORD, in the | light | of your | presence.
16. They rejoice daily | in your | Name; *
they are | jubi- · lant | in your | righteousness.
17. For you are the glory | of their | strength, *
and by your favor our | might | is ex- | alted.
18. Truly, the LORD | is our | ruler; *
the Holy One of | Israel | is our | King.
19. You spoke once in a vision and said to your | faithful | people: *
"I have set the crown upon a warrior and have exalted one | chosen | out · of the | people.
20. I have found | David · my | servant; *
with my holy oil have | I an- | ointed | him.
21. My hand will | hold him | fast *
and my | arm will | make him | strong.
22. No enemy | shall de- | ceive him, *
nor any | wicked · man | bring him | down.
23. I will crush his | foes be- | fore him *
and | strike down | those who | hate him.
24. My faithfulness and love | shall be | with him, *
and he shall be vic- | torious | through my | Name.
25. I shall make his do- | minion · ex- | tend *
from the | Great Sea | to the | River.
26. He will say to me, | 'You are · my | Father, *
my God, and the | rock of | my sal- | vation."
27. I will make | him my | firstborn *
and higher than the | kings | of the | earth.
28. I will keep my love for | him for | ever *
and my covenant | will stand | firm for | him.
29. I will establish his | line for | ever *
and his throne | as the | days of | heaven."
30. "If his children for- | sake my | law, *
and do not walk ac- | cording | to my | judgments;
31. If they | break my | statutes *
and | do not | keep · my com- | mandments;
32. I will punish their transgressions | with a | rod *
and their in- | iqui- · ties | with the | lash.
33. But I will not take my | love from | him, *
nor | let my | faithful- · ness prove | false.
34. I will not | break my | covenant, *
nor change what has gone | out | of my | lips.
35. Once for all I have sworn | by my | holiness: *
'I | will not | lie to | David.
36. His line shall en- | dure for | ever *
and his throne | as the | sun be- | fore me.
37. It shall stand fast for evermore | like the | moon, *
the abiding | witness | in the | sky.'"
38. But you have cast off and rejected your anointed; *
you have become enraged at him.
39. You have broken your covenant with your servant, *
defiled his crown, and hurled it to the ground.
40. You have breached all his walls *
and laid his strongholds in ruins.
41. All who pass by despoil him; *
he has become the scorn of his neighbors.
42. You have exalted the right hand | of his | foes *
and made | all his | ene- · mies re- | joice.
43. You have turned back the | edge · of his | sword *
and have not sus- | tained | him in | battle.
44. You have put an | end · to his | splendor *
and cast his | throne | to the | ground.
45. You have cut short the | days · of his | youth *
and have | covered | him with | shame.
46. How long will you hide yourself, O LORD? will you hide your- | self for | ever? *
how long will your | anger | burn like | fire?
47. Remember, LORD, how | short life | is, *
how frail | you have | made all | flesh.
48. Who can live and | not see | death? *
who can save himself from the | power | of the | grave?
49. Where, Lord, are your loving- | kindness- · es of | old, *
which you promised | David | in your | faithfulness?
50. Remember, Lord, how your | servant · is | mocked, *
how I carry in my bosom the | taunts of | many | peoples,
51. The taunts your enemies have | hurled, O | LORD, *
which they hurled at the | heels of | your an- | ointed.
52. Blessed be the LORD for | ever- | more! *
A- | men, I | say, A- | men.
1 O | LORD our | Governor, *
how exalted is your | Name in | all the | world!
2 Out of the mouths of | infants · and | children *
your majesty is | praised a- | bove the | heavens.
3 You have set up a stronghold a- | gainst your | adversaries, *
to quell the | ene- | my · and the | avenger.
4 When I consider your heavens, the | work · of your | fingers, *
the moon and the stars | you have | set · in their | courses,
5 What is man that you should be | mindful | of him? *
the son of man that | you should | seek him | out?
6 You have made him but little | lower · than the | angels; *
you ad- | orn · him with | glory · and | honor;
7 You give him mastery over the | works · of your | hands; *
you put | all things | under · his | feet:
8 All | sheep and | oxen, *
even the | wild | beasts · of the | field,
9 The birds of the air, the | fish · of the | sea, *
and whatsoever | walks · in the | paths · of the | sea.
10 O | LORD our | Governor, *
how exalted is your | Name in | all the | world!
1 Lord, you have | been our | refuge *
from one gener- | ation | to an- | other.
2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or the land and the | earth were | born, *
from age to | age | you are | God.
3 You turn us back to the | dust and | say, *
"Go | back, O | child of | earth."
4 For a thousand years in your sight are like yesterday | when · it is | past *
and | like a | watch · in the | night.
5 You sweep us away | like a | dream; *
we fade away | sudden- · ly | like the | grass.
6 In the morning it is | green and | flourishes; *
in the evening it is | dried | up and | withered.
7 For we consume away in | your dis- | pleasure; *
we are afraid because of your | wrathful | indig- | nation.
8 Our iniquities you have | set be- | fore you, *
and our secret sins in the | light | of your | countenance.
9 When you are angry, all our | days are | gone; *
we bring our years to an | end | like a | sigh.
10 The span of our life is seventy years, perhaps in | strength · even | eighty; *
yet the sum of them is but labor and sorrow, for they pass away | quickly · and | we are | gone.
11 Who regards the | power · of your | wrath? *
who rightly | fears your | indig- | nation?
12 So teach us to | number · our | days *
that we may ap- | ply our | hearts to | wisdom.
13 Return, O LORD; how long | will you | tarry? *
be | gracious | to your | servants.
14 Satisfy us by your loving-kindness | in the | morning; *
so shall we rejoice and be glad | all the | days · of our | life.
15 Make us glad by the measure of the days that | you af- | flicted us *
and the years in which we | suf- | fered ad- | versity.
16 Show your | servants · your | works *
and your | splendor | to their | children.
17 May the graciousness of the LORD our God | be up- | on us; *
prosper the work of our hands; | prosper · our | handi- | work.
1. He who dwells under the shelter | of the · Most | High, *
abides under the | shadow | of the · Al- | mighty.
2. He shall say to the LORD, "You are my | refuge · and my | stronghold, *
my God in | whom I | put my | trust.
3. He shall deliver you from the | snare · of the | hunter *
and | from the | deadly | pestilence.
4. He shall cover you with his pinions, and you shall find refuge | under · his | wings; *
his faithfulness shall | be a | shield and | buckler.
5. You shall not be afraid of any | terror · by | night, *
nor of the | arrow · that | flies by | day.
6. Of the plague that | stalks · in the | darkness, *
nor of the sickness that | lays waste | at mid- | day.
7. A thousand shall fall at your side and ten thousand at | your right | hand, *
but it | shall not | come near | you.
8. Your eyes have only | to be- | hold *
to see the re- | ward | of the | wicked.
9. Because you have made the | LORD your | refuge, *
and the Most | High your | habit- | ation,
10. There shall no evil | happen | to you, *
neither shall any | plague come | near your | dwelling.
11. For he shall give his angels charge | over | you, *
to | keep you · in | all your | ways.
12. They shall bear you | in their | hands, *
lest you dash your | foot a- | gainst a | stone.
13. You shall tread upon the | lion · and the | adder; *
you shall trample the young lion and the | serpent | under · your | feet.
14. Because he is bound to me in love, therefore I will de- | liver | him; *
I will protect him, be- | cause he | knows my | Name.
15. He shall call upon me, and I will | answer | him; *
I will rescue him and | bring | him to | honor.
16. With long life will I | satis- · fy | him, *
and | show him | my sal- | vation.
1 It is a good thing to give | thanks · to the | LORD, *
and to sing praises to your | Name, | O Most | High;
2 To tell of your loving-kindness | early · in the | morning *
and of your | faithful- · ness | in the | night season;
3 On the psaltery, and | on the | lyre, *
and to the | melo- · dy | of the | harp.
4 For you have made me glad by your | acts, O | LORD; *
and I shout for joy | because · of the | works · of your | hands.
5 LORD, how | great · are your | works! *
your | thoughts are | very | deep.
6 The dullard does not know, nor does the fool | under- | stand, *
that though the wicked grow like weeds, and all the | workers · of in- | iqui- · ty | flourish,
7 They flourish only to be des- | troyed for | ever; *
but you, O LORD, are | exalted · for | ever- | more.
8 For lo, your enemies, O LORD, lo, your | ene- · mies shall | perish, *
and all the workers of | ini- · quity | shall be | scattered.
9 But my horn you have exalted like the horns of | wild | bulls; *
I am an- | ointed | with fresh | oil.
10 My eyes also gloat | over · my | enemies, *
and my ears rejoice to hear the doom of the wicked who | rise | up a- | gainst me.
11 The righteous shall flourish | like a | palm tree, *
and shall spread abroad | like a | cedar · of | Lebanon.
12 Those who are planted in the | house · of the | LORD *
shall flourish in the | courts | of our | God;
13 They shall still bear fruit in | old | age; *
they | shall be | green and | succulent;
14 That they may show how | upright · the | LORD is, *
my Rock, | in whom | there is no | fault.
1. The LORD is King; he has put on | splendid · ap- | parel; *
the LORD has put on his apparel and | girded · him- | self with | strength.
2. He has made the whole | world so | sure *
that it | can- | not be | moved.
3. Ever since the world began, your throne has | been est- | ablished; *
you | are from | ever- | lasting.
4. The waters have lifted up, O LORD, the waters have | lifted · up their | voice; *
the waters have | lifted · up their | pounding | waves.
5. Mightier than the sound of many waters, mightier than the | breakers · of the | sea, *
mightier is the | LORD who | dwells on | high.
6. Your testimonies are | very | sure, *
and holiness adorns your house, O LORD, for ever | and for | ever- | more.
1. O LORD | God of | vengeance, *
O God of | vengeance, | show your- | self.
2. Rise up, O | judge · of the | world; *
give the | arrogant · their | just de- | serts.
3. How long shall the | wicked, · O | LORD, *
how | long · shall the | wicked | triumph?
4. They bluster | in their | insolence; *
all evil- | doers · are | full of | boasting.
5. They crush your | people, · O | LORD, *
and af- | flict your | chosen | nation.
6. They murder the | widow · and the | stranger *
and | put the | orphans · to | death.
7. Yey they say, "The | LORD · does not | see, *
the God of | Jacob | takes no | notice."
8. Consider well, you dullards a- | mong the | people; *
when will | you fools | under- | stand?
9. He that planted the ear, | does he · not | hear? *
he that formed the | eye, does | he not | see?
10. He who admonishes the nations, | will he · not | punish? *
he who teaches the | world, has | he no | knowledge?
11. The LORD knows our | human | thoughts; *
how like a | puff of | wind they | are.
12. Happy are they whom you in- | struct, O | LORD! *
whom you | teach out | of your | law.
13. To give them rest in | evil | days, *
until a | pit is | dug · for the | wicked.
14. For the LORD will not | abandon · his | people; *
nor will | he for- | sake his | own.
15. For judgment will a- | gain be | just, *
and all the | true of | heart will | follow it.
16. Who rose up for me a- | gainst the | wicked? *
who took my part against the evildoers.
17. If the LORD had not | come · to my | help, *
I should have | dwelt · in the | land of | silence.
18. As often as I said, "My | foot has | slipped," *
your | love, O | LORD, up- | held me.
19. When many cares | fill my | mind, *
your consol- | ations | cheer my | soul.
20. Can a corrupt tribunal have | any | part with you, *
one which frames | evil | into | law?
21. They conspire against the | life · of the | just *
and con- | demn the | inno- · cent to | death.
22. But the LORD has be- | come my | stronghold, *
and my | God the | rock of · my | trust.
23. He will turn their wickedness back upon them and destroy them in their | own | malice; *
the | LORD our | God · will de- | stroy them.
1 Come, let us | sing · to the | LORD; *
let us shout for joy to the | Rock of | our sal- | vation.
2 Let us come before his | presence · with | thanksgiving *
and raise a loud | shout to | him with | psalms.
3 For the LORD is a | great | God, *
and a great | King a- | bove all | gods.
4 In his hand are the | caverns · of the | earth, *
and the heights of the | hills are | his | also.
5 The sea is his, | for he | made it, *
and his hands have | molded | the dry | land.
6 Come, let us bow down, and | bend the | knee, *
and kneel be- | fore the | LORD our | Maker.
7 For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture and the | sheep | of his | hand. *
Oh, that today you would | hearken | to his | voice!
8 Harden not your hearts, as your forebears | did · in the | wilderness, *
at Meribah, and on that day at Massah, | when they | tempted | me.
9 They put me | to the | test, *
though | they had | seen my | works.
10 Forty years long I detested that gener- | ation · and | said, *
"This people are wayward in their hearts; they | do not | know my | ways."
1. Sing to the | LORD a · new | song; *
sing to the | LORD, | all the · whole | earth.
2. Sing to the LORD and | bless his | Name; *
proclaim the good news of his sal- | vation · from | day to | day.
3. Declare his glory a- | mong the | nations *

4. For great is the LORD and | greatly · to be | praised; *
he is more to be | feared than | all | gods.
5. As for the gods of the nations, | they are · but | idols; *
but it is the | LORD who | made the | heavens.
6. Oh, the majesty and mag- | nifi- · cence | of his | presence! *

11. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea thunder and | all · that is | in it; *
let the field be joyful and | all that | is there- | in.
12. Then shall all the trees of the wood shout for joy before the | LORD · when he | comes, *
when he | comes to | judge the | earth.

and the | peoples | with his | truth.

the earth | sees it · and | is a- | fraid.
5. The mountains melt like wax at the | presence · of the | LORD, *
at the presence of the | Lord | of the · whole | earth.
6. The heavens de- | clare his | righteousness, *
and all the | peoples | see his | glory.
7. Confounded be all who worship carved images and de- | light in · false | gods! *
Bow down be- | fore him, | all you | gods.
8. Zion hears and is glad, and the cities of | Judah · re- | joice, *
because of your | judg- | ments, O | LORD.

the lands and | those who | dwell there- | in.
9. Let the rivers | clap their | hands *
and let the hills ring out with joy before the LORD, when he | comes to | judge the | earth.
10. In righteousness shall he | judge the | world *
and the | peo- | ples with | equity.
1. The LORD is King; let the | people | tremble; *
he is enthroned upon the | cheru- · bim; | let the · earth | shake.
2. The LORD is | great in | Zion; *
he is | high a- | bove all | peoples.

he is | high a- | bove all | peoples.
4. "O mighty King, lover of justice, you have est- | ablished | equity; *
you have executed justice and | righteous- | ness in | Jacob."
5. Proclaim the greatness of the LORD our God and fall down be- | fore his | footstool; *
he | is the | Holy | One.
6. Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among those who call up- | on his | Name, *
they called upon the | LORD, | and he | answered them.
7. He spoke to them out of the | pillar · of | cloud; *
they kept his testimonies and the de- | cree | that he | gave them
8. "O LORD our God, you answered | them in- | deed; *
you were a God who forgave them, yet punished them | for their | evil | deeds.
9. Proclaim the greatness of the LORD our God and worship him upon his | holy | hill; *
for the LORD our | God | is the | Holy One.
1 I will give thanks to you, O LORD, with my | whole | heart; *
I will tell of | all your | marvel- · ous | works.
2 I will be glad and re- | joice in | you; *
I will sing to your | Name, | O Most | High.
3 When my enemies are | driven | back, *
they will stumble and | perish | at your | presence.
4 For you have maintained my | right · and my | cause; *
you sit upon your | throne | judging | right.
5 You have rebuked the ungodly and des- | troyed the | wicked; *
you have blotted out their | name for | ever · and | ever.
6 As for the enemy, they are finished, in per- | petual | ruin, *
their cities plowed under, the | memor- · y | of them | perished;
7 But the LORD is en- | throned for | ever; *
he has | set up · this | throne for | judgment.
8 It is he who rules the | world with | righteousness; *
he judges the | peo- | ples with | equity.
9 The LORD will be a refuge | for · the op- | pressed, *
a | refuge · in | time of | trouble.
10 Those who know your Name will put their | trust in | you, *
for you never forsake | those who | seek you, · O | LORD.
11 Sing praise to the LORD who | dwells in | Zion; *
proclaim to the peoples the | things | he has | done.
12 The Avenger of blood will re- | member | them; *
he will not forget the | cry of | the af- | flicted.
13 Have pity on | me, O | LORD; *
see the misery I suffer from those who hate me, O you who lift me up | from the | gate of | death;
14 So that I may tell of all your praises and rejoice in | your sal- | vation *
in the | gates · of the | city of | Zion.
15 The ungodly have fallen into the | pit they | dug, *
and in the snare they set | is their | own foot | caught.
16 The LORD is known by his | acts of | justice; *
the wicked are trapped in the | works of | their own | hands.
17 The wicked shall be given over | to the | grave, *
and also all the | people | that for- · get | God.
18 For the needy shall not always | be for- | gotten, *
and the hope of the poor | shall not | perish · for | ever.
19 Rise up, O LORD, let not the ungodly have the | upper | hand; *
let | them be | judged be- | fore you.
20 Put fear upon | them, O | LORD; *
let the ungodly | know they | are but | mortal.
1. I was smaller | than my | brothers, *
the youngest | son | of my | father.

a | lyre | with my | fingers.
4. I gave glory to the | LORD and | said, *
"Neither do the mountains testify to him, nor the | hills pro- | claim his | Name."
5. Give echo to my | words, O | trees; *
re- | hearse my | deeds, O | sheep!
6. Who can proclaim the | works · of the | LORD, *
and | who pro- | claim his | deeds?
7. For God has | seen it | all; *
he has heard all | and at- | tended | to it.
8. He sent his prophet | to an- | oint me, *
even | Samuel | to ex- | alt me.
9. My brothers, handsome to behold, went forth and met him; | handsome · of | figure, *
they were wonderful to see, tall in stature and | beauti- | ful of | hair.
10. Even so, the LORD GOD | did not | choose them; *
rather he chose me who kept the flock, and an- | ointed | me with | oil.
11. He set me as prince | over · his | people, *
and appointed me a ruler over the | children | of his | covenant.
12. I went out to | meet the | Philistine, *
who taunted me from the | ranks | of the | enemy.

150. They draw near who in | malice | persecute me; *
they are | very | far · from your | law.
151. You, O LORD, are | near at | hand, *
and | all · your com- | mand- · ments are | true.
152. Long have I known from | your de- | crees *
that you have e- | stablished | them for | ever.
153. Behold my affliction | and de- | liver me, *
for I do | not for- | get your | law.
154. Plead my cause | and re- | deem me; *
according to your | promise, | give me | life.
155. Deliverance is | far · from the | wicked, *
for they | do not | study · your | statutes.
156. Great is your com- | passion, · O | LORD; *
preserve my life, ac- | cording | to your | judgments.
157. There are many who persecute | and op- | press me, *
yet I have not | swerved from | your de- | crees.

with justice | and in | perfect | faithfulness.
139. My indignation | has con- | sumed me, *
because my | enemies · for- | get your | words.

and your | servant | holds it | dear.
141. I am small and of | little · ac- | count, *
yet I do | not for- | get · your com- | mandments.
142. Your justice is an ever- | lasting | justice *
and | your law | is the | truth.
143. Trouble and distress have | come up- | on me, *
yet your com- | mandments | are · my de- | light.
144. The righteousness of your decrees is | ever- | lasting; *
grant me under- | standing, · that | I may | live.
113. I hate those who have a di- | vided | heart, *
but | your law | do I | love.
